        <h2>BIG QUEST MOD LIST</h2>

        <p>These quest mods are simply huge, either because they involve a lot of elements, are long and complex, or because of their sheer scope.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/11598" target="_blank">Tears of the Fiend: Redemption</a> by Simyaz</h4>
        <p><i>Update 1.2 -- </i><b>Redemption</b><i> -- is out!</i> More than a year in the making, this mod brings together two of the most compelling story-driven mods released to date -- <b>The Legacy</b> and <b>The Butcher of Armindale</b> -- merging them into a unified storyline that will rock your world like nothing else has before. Includes the complete story/quest arcs from The Legacy and The Butcher (see the separate listings for those mods below) along with a new conclusion that takes place after the events in both of the original mods. Like the originals, this is a complex, multi-pathed quest/companion adventure that spans numerous encounters with more than 4,000 lines of dialogue, all driven by a powerful and riveting story. There are multiple paths you can take through the quests, each resulting in varying encounters and endings depending on your choices and actions. An instant classic, to be sure. Does not include voice acting. Note that you must not run this at the same time as The Legacy or The Butcher of Armindale -- if you have either of those mods, you must remove them before loading this one. <i>The 1.2 update adds a massive new quest called Redemption that can be played during the main part of the story or afterward (if you've already completed TotF 1.0).</i><br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/12997" target="_blank">The Lost Spires</a> by Liquidgraph</h4>
        <p>This huge mod has already become a fan favorite. It adds a massive series of quests centered around the ancient mysteries of Tamriel. You will work your way up through the ranks of the Archeology Guild as you explore new, exotic locales while attempting to unravel a plot of sinister deceit, betrayal, and doom. This single story arc spans more than 15 hours of gameplay, including 10 new dungeons, epic battles, tons of lore, numerous NPCs, and more than 100 new custom meshes. Other features include two entire cave retextures, more than a dozen retextured creatures, new loot, new architecture, new boss creatures, a functioning bear trap, and more. The mod does not include voice acting, but this doesn't seem to be hurting its popularity. <i>Don't miss this one, folks!</i><br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/5022" target="_blank">Bartholm</a> by jsera</h4>
        <p><i>Version 5.0 is out!</i> This incredible mod adds a new town, a new island village, numerous NPCs, and much more -- it now has 24 quests and many of them are repeatable! It features very good voice acting for all the dialog and excellent quests. Ruled by Count Serverus Victrix, Bartholm is a small town consisting of a Castle, Arena, Inn, General Store, Chapel, Stables, Mages' Guild, and eight houses. The village of Slartholm, situated on the Isle of Slart, includes an Inn, General Store, Blacksmith, Barracks, Alchemist Tent, and three houses. In Bartholm, you can uncover a plot against the Count, take on random Dark Brotherhood contracts, random pickpocketing missions for the Thieves Guild, fight in the Arena and become Bartholm's Grand Champion, fight in daily free-for-all matches and defend your title once a week after you're the champion, attempt to eradicate some ghosts haunting the town, solve a longstanding skooma problem, go hunting with Filthy Fargus, search for a bottle of Rockville Rum, help out with an unwanted house guest issue, rent a room at the Lodge, purchase a house in town from the Count and furnish it, and of course create mayhem around town and get arrested or killed by the guards. If you get bored in town, you can join the Bartholm Foreign Legion, travel to the island village of Slartholm, help defend the island from a Moarmer attack, go hunting pirates on the high seas, and much more. The quest dealing with the count and his family is particularly well done (you can side with either the Dark Brotherhood or the count). Highly recommended.<br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/11999" target="_blank">The Fight for Castle Ravenpride</a> by Arandor</h4>
        <p>This is another amazing German mod now translated into English. The Fight for Castle Ravenpride tells the dark story of a castle high in the Jerall Mountains. This extensive, multi-hour quest features incredible voice acting, desperate struggles, new weapons and armor, an elaborate in-game cutscene, and extensive lore, including five new books (two of them written by the German fantasy author Antje Grueger for this mod).

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/12016" target="_blank">Blood & Mud: Dirt Deluxe Anglais</a> by ~Ryan~</h4>
        <p>This is a complete English translation of the original German mod, Blood & Mud I-III. It completely revamps the city of Bravil to be a much darker, more brutal place, infested by all manner of scum. It adds more than twenty new NPCs with amazing voice acting spanning more than 800 unique dialogs across three major new quests. It adds many new buildings to Bravil, as well as tons of new items. We finally get a chance to play this classic German mod! Don't forget to check out the awesome <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111001141216/http://www.planetoblivion.de/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=855&Itemid=98" target="_blank">trailer (Archive)</a>! If you also use Qarl's Texture Pack 3, there's a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/12029" target="_blank">compatibility patch</a> available.<br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.bethsoft.com/bgsforums/index.php?showtopic=802233" target="_blank">Daggerfall Memories: The Liberation of Cybiades</a> by Deathless Aphrodite</h4>
        <p>This excellent quest mod adds only one new quest, but it's listed with the "big mods" because it takes place in an entirely new worldspace -- the island of Cybiades (from Daggerfall) -- and includes tons of new models, textures, weather types, creatures, NPCs, tree types, sounds effects, and much more. The quest is incredibly well done and includes excellent voice acting for all the dialog. The story revolves around an evil threat to the settlers on the island. The amount of work that went into this is simply staggering.<br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/13336" target="_blank">Kvatch Aftermath</a> by giskard</h4>
        <p><i>Updated to 6.2 Final!</i> This mod rebuilds Kvatch into a fully functional city. Almost every building is occupied and every citizen has a life of their own. Provided you saved Kvatch, you enter the city as the Hero of Kvatch and have the option to become Count of Kvatch and control its developement. From then on, you will need to speak to various people to find new quests that will allow you to improve the city further. Some NPCs may not have any quests for you at first, but as you develop the city, their needs will grow and more quests will become available. Most quests cost you money, but some are combat-related. Each quest leads to ever more expensive improvements becoming affordable. Some renovations benefit you directly, but most will improve the city itself. Eventually, you will finish upgrading kvatch and it will become the city it once was, but at first the only renovations you will see completed are the ones the citizens have done on their own. Kvatch Citizens enjoy walks in the memorial gardens, but most like to drink and can be frequently found in one of the two pubs when they are not busy. Others will visit the rebuilt castle and admire the trophy cabinets. Kvatch has an active night life, but most people are in bed by Midnight, especially since the ghosts of former citizens who died during the battle may haunt the areas they once knew. Its safe to make any Kvatch Guard a companion using <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/3066" target="_blank">Toaster Says Share</a>. <i>Earlier versions could only be used after completing the Kvatch Quests and once you're already the Hero of Kvatch, but the 5.x versions and later work even from the start of the game.</i><br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/6623" target="_blank">Knights of the White Stallion</a> by Cleitanious/Marine OKeefe/Modder 300/ByblosHex</h4>
        <p><i>New Version 4.4 is out!</i> This mod takes Mazoga the Orc's story to a new level. It adds new quests, dungeons, weapons, and armor, all focusing on the Knights of the White Stallion. The new quests and dungeons focus on dramatically expanding the Knights' conflict with the Black Bow bandits, as well as making both the Knights and the Black Bow more vibrant and interesting. Learn why Count Leyawiin hates the Bandits so much. Save the Count's missing daughter. Confront the Black Bow leader, Gafgarian The Black. Gain your own White Stallion mount and perhaps even become captain of the Knights, giving you access to the Captain's Hall and a special Hollowed Minotaur's Horn that can be blown to call your mighty steed. The White Stallion Lodge is dramatically expanded and remade. A roaring good time for good-guy types.<br>

        <h4><a href="OOO/OOO_Guide.html" target="_blank">Oscuro's Oblivion Overhaul</a> by Sotobrastos</h4>
        <p><i>Updated to 1.32.Final!</i> This mod is much more than a quest mod, and most of what it does is beyond the scope of this blurb, but it does include several excellent new freeform quests. It also adds a huge amount of great lore and dramatically rebalances the risk-vs-reward for most of the vanilla quests in the game, as well as making many of the random dungeons a lot less random. Unlike previous versions, many of the new quests now give journal entries, but you still have to figure them out the old-fashioned way (yes, you do still have a brain, don't you?) by deciphering hints and clues from books, scrolls, notices, and notes. Start by reading the Imperial Notices posted near the gates of most major cities. If you get completely stuck, you can always check the <a href="OOO/OOO_Spoilers.html" target="_blank">OOO Spoilers (Archive)</a>, or just wait until you stumble across them during your other adventures. This mod won <b>GameSpy's Best PC Mod of the Year</b> award for 2006. Although GameSpy is long gone these days, some evidence of this fact remains in a few obscure corners of the web: <a href="https://www.gamebanshee.com/news/81617-gamespys-2006-pc-game-of-the-year-awards.html" target="_blank">(1)</a> | <a href="https://forum.esforces.com/threads/gamespys-game-of-the-year-2006.64554/#post-784272">(2)</a> | <a href="https://www.overwritten.net/forum/index.php?topic=1058.0" target="_blank">(3)</a>.<br>

        <h4><a href="http://forum.4drulers.com/showthread.php?t=11492" target="_blank">The Romancing of Eyja</a> by MadMole</h4>
        <p><i>Updated! Version 1.3 Beta is out! See the Homepage link below for details</i>. This mod is designed to add romance to Oblivion, and make life at Rosethorn Hall much better. The maid you hire when purchasing Rosethorn Hall's servants quarters is really boring, so this mod seeks to expose her potential, in a manner of speaking. The big attraction here are three multi-part quests to date Eyja and win her heart. However, there is plenty of "eye candy", too! Eyja is younger looking and wears make up. Eyja has roughly 65 new voiced dialog lines, all reconstructed from the original Lynda Carter voice work for Nords in Oblivion. It also includes three new maid outfits, a new dress for the big date, custom hair, a new swimming pool that Eyja visits every day (she wears the swimsuit and has a special wet hair model for that AI package), a fully functional wardrobe (the user can make her wear what they want by placing items in the drawers), a wide variety of clothing and AI packages so you never know what Eyja might be doing at the moment (including a custom animation of her scrubbing the floor), and much more (including a billiards table!).<br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.bethsoft.com/bgsforums/index.php?showtopic=678795" target="_blank">Thieves Arsenal Mission Zero: Odd Jobs</a> by scruggsywuggsy the ferret</h4>
        <p>This mod primarily focuses on expanding the stealth gameplay options for thieves (taking inspiration from the venerable Thief series). However, it also includes a great random quest feature (hence the title "Odd Jobs"), in addition to significantly expanding the roleplaying possibilities for thieves. It includes full voice acting, a ton of great new items, and new AI behaviors that alter the way NPCs and guards react to you. The Odd Jobs quests are pseudo-randomly-generated quests that all follow a similar pattern: go to a randomly-selected dungeon, locate a randomly-selected treasure stored in a randomly-placed chest, and return with it. The catch is that you have to succeed without killing anyone, and you get bonus points if you manage to do it without ever being detected. The best part? These quests never run out! New items include the Blackjack (knock people unconscious), Noisemakers (distract opponents while you sneak past undetected), Vine Arrows (create climbable vines for circumventing obstacles and making quick getaways), Gas Arrows (put enemies to sleep), Water Arrows (extinguish lights), Grease Arrows (slippery traps), and more. New AI behaviors include Suspicion (NPCs now notice odd occurences around them, like lights going out or unconscious bodies lying around, and suspicious actors will actively search for you), Unconscious (NPCs and creatures can be rendered unconscious, and while unconscious, they can be drowned, looted, and dragged around, etc.), Crime (normal civilians will flee to the guards to report your crimes, and guards will not arrest or fine you unless they can actually see you), and more. Highly recommended for sneaky types. Check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/profile?user=scruggsy" target="_blank">YouTube video here</a>. Requires OBSE.<br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.bethsoft.com/bgsforums/index.php?showtopic=677258" target="_blank">Dremora Companion</a> by b3w4r3 (and a large team)</h4>
        <p>This is yet another quest mod disguised as a companion mod. It adds eight new quests and includes extensive voice acting, new armor and weapons, a new player home you can acquire, many retextured interiors, and a great storyline. The story starts with haunting dreams of a Dremora wrongfully imprisoned in Dagon's Deadlands -- and leads you to eventually taking assignments from Lord Dagon himself! This mod is simply chock-full of amazing new features. The final release is definitely a landmark event in Oblivion modding history. For example, your companion Amoz can be added to any of the main factions in vanilla Oblivion by simply summoning him in the proper guild interiors. This is just one small example -- touches of perfection like this abound. <i>Highly recommended</i> (but probably not for good-guy types :-).<br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.bethsoft.com/bgsforums/index.php?showtopic=696126" target="_blank">The Sentient Weapon</a> by NarkyBark</h4>
        <p><i>Update! (OOO compatibility patch added).</i> A wandering weaponsmith gives you an offer - he'll make you a sentient weapon if you can just get him all the materials. It promises to be powerful, but also potentially comical, as the weapon will audibly comment on your adventures as you go. You'll get to choose the type of weapon you want and choose between three different personalities for the weapon (or all three!): Fred the Coward, who is an eternal pessimist; Atkivir the Murderer, who delights in misery and killing; and Samson the (wanna be) Hero, who's just a regular guy and isn't terribly special. The mod includes more than 800 lines of voice-acted dialog for the weapon. Each personality also has mildly different combat abilities, but this is especially true if you make a critical hit (which is fairly rare). A critical hit from Fred might make the enemy run away, one from Atkivir deals heavy damage, and one from Samson cripples their combat abilities. Also includes three mini quests -- one for each personality. Help with a task involving a past problem and you can find out more about their lives. Completing a weapon task makes that weapon more powerful, and gives it a hated enemy, so that the more of the specific foe you defeat, the more powerful your weapon gets! If you also use Francesco's Leveled Creatures-Items mod or Oscuro's Oblivion Overhaul, there's a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/11875" target="_blank">compatibility patch</a> to rebalance the Sentient Weapon stats in accordance with OOO/MOBS stats.<br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/3027" target="_blank">Ruined Tail's Tale</a> by Simyaz</h4>
        <p><i>New Version 2.5 is out!</i> This is one of the best Oblivion quest mods released so far. It is a quest mod disguised as a companion mod, featuring an Argonian named Ruined Tail. It includes detailed character conversations and an in-depth storyline. What the player says will directly affect Ruin's development as a character and determine the eventual outcome of his quest. The quest itself is long, detailed, engaging, and further enhances the concept that Ruin is not simply an NPC ally, but more of a definitive companion, with his own personality, needs and fears. There are multiple endings to the quest. It includes some voice acting, but most of the dialog is silent due to the sheer quantity of dialog. <i>This is one of my all-time favorites, and also one of the most popular quest mods ever made for Oblivion.</i><br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/5902" target="_blank">Myths and Legends: Weapons</a> by TemplarGFX, GrimDeath, SykoFox, GamerGirlx</h4>
        <p>This mod adds quests to recover 14 unique artifacts. Each weapon has a story filled with clues that you must decipher and follow in order to find the weapons. The quests are designed for high-level players. Finding these weapons at a low level will be impossible for some, and the weapons will likely be overpowered for low-level characters if you do find them. The difficulty of the quests ranges from moderate to insane. This is intentional since the weapons are powerful and the difficulty is commensurate with this. To start, you must seek out various books at merchants in various cities. Don't forget to add <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/6226" target="_blank">the update</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111001141216/http://files.filefront.com/grimsmal2patchrar/;5347293;/fileinfo.html" target="_blank">the patch (Archive)</a>.

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/5156" target="_blank">Thievery in the Imperial City</a> by JOG</h4>
        <p>Not all merchants in the Imperial City are as honest as we've been led to believe. Derrien Venoit, who runs the Discount Merchandise shop in the market district, has no qualms about buying stolen goods. In fact, thieves in the Imperial City know that Derrien sometimes gives tips about where to find worthwhile loot. This mod adds 11 new quests for a thief and two miscellaneous quests. It features full voice-over dialog.<br>

        <p>This mod features a unique storyline with six video cutscenes between quest stages. The story involves you in a sinister and cursed plot to discover a cure for Lycanthropy. This eventually leads to the discovery of the DangerSense ability. Includes full voice acting.<br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/13398" target="_blank">Mighty Umbra</a> by Damar Stiehl</h4>
        <p>This quest mod revolves around Umbra the Sword, which is among the mightiest weapons to have ever been forged in Tamriel. Created by an ancient witch, who was executed for bringing a weapon of such unadulterated evil into the world, it exists for one thing and one thing only: to slay all things that come in its path and consume their souls. Men and mer, kings and paupers, heroes and villains, and even daedra have all bled for Umbra, their Animi devoured by the ever-hungry blade. This is an extremely tough, multi-stage quest with very harsh conditions, but the rewards are well worth it. It provides a true-to-lore expansion of Umbra the Sword's history and makes the sword into a living entity with a deep thirst for blood and souls. <i>This mod is highly recommended for those who relish extreme challenges. It's also one of my personal all-time favorites.</i> <i>Re-Uploaded by buddah!</i><br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.bethsoft.com/bgsforums/index.php?showtopic=667885" target="_blank">Butcher of Armindale</a> by Simyaz</h4>
        <p><i>See </i><b>Tears of the Fiend</b><i> for new updates to this mod!</i> This is another quest mod disguised as a companion mod, featuring Cleon, the "Butcher of Armindale". Cleon is malevolent, cold-hearted, and haunted by a metaphorical beast that spurs his every action towards dire consequences. What the player says will directly affect Cleon's development as a character and determine the eventual outcome of his quest. As the story progresses, Cleon's quest becomes more involved, eventually leading to a final showdown of suitably epic proportions. There are three possible endings to the story, each of which stems from two different final encounters (both of which are dependent on your ability to succeed or fail at the final fight and, more important, the story path you choose). Includes voice acting for most of the new NPCs added by the mod as well as most of the conversations with Cleon.<br>

        <p>A man named Alex is searching for help in Bravil. He wants you to retrieve the Elemental Stones from the temple and light the Elemental Lighthouses with them, so the elements in Tamriel will be balanced. But, are Alex's intentions really that noble? Did he really tell you everything? And who is this Wise One, who tries to prevent you from lighting the lighthouses, saying you are making a mistake? Loosely based on the GBA game Golden Sun, this mod focuses on puzzle-action challenges rather than fighting-action. You'll have to go through a series of puzzle challenges to collect the elemental stones and then another series of puzzle challenges to light the four elemental lighthouses. Examples of these puzzle challenges include running over a crumbling bridge while avoiding falling rocks, finding your way through a maze with invisible paths in the air and lightning shooting stones, and so forth. Even fairly low-level characters should be able to survive if your wit is quick. Not compatible with Open Cities: Bravil because Alex will never show up. Also, don't try to bring any companions because they will get stuck. Not for TES lore freaks. Everyone else should have a blast.<br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/6855" target="_blank">Servant of the Dawn</a> by Endrek</h4>
        <p>Disappointed that the main questline of Oblivion forces you to be the "good guy"? This mod lets characters who have already completed the main quest to "redeem" themselves by joining the second wave efforts of the Mythic Dawn. It starts where the main questline left off and expands the Mythic Dawn faction with a complete set of ranks and quests. It includes new artifacts and powers to wield, a branching questline with several different outcomes depending on your actions, letting you dabble in the inner workings and politics of a Daedra cult and command a host of followers, from acolytes to dremora. You can rise through the ranks to become the new Master, or perhaps even more powerful...<br>

        <p>Led by a Dremora who was banished from the plane of Oblivion for his love of science, an underground cult is planning to rule all of Cyrodiil. Can you stop them? This is a remake of an older mod called "The Pyramid of Knowledge."<br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/6488" target="_blank">Enhanced Quest Roleplaying</a> by wsrowland</h4>
        <p>This mod is an attempt to improve roleplaying in Oblivion by giving the player more conversation options with NPCs during quests, providing different ways to complete certain quests, allowing the player to refuse quests he/she does not want to do (through dialogue, not just ignoring the quest), altering certain journal entries to give a more neutral summary of events, modifying changes in fame/infamy to better correspond with good, neutral, or evil decisions. The main focus of the mod is on the "major" miscellaneous quests, as they seem the most restrictive in terms of roleplaying (all characters get them, so all characters should be able to complete them in a fitting way). Bethesda's focused on designing these quests for good characters, so most of the changes add options for neutral or evil characters, as the good options are already well-integrated. However, there are a few cases where the good choice is not so well represented, and those have been changed as well.<br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/6976" target="_blank">Hand of Dawn</a> by Vic10us</h4>
        <p>This mod tells the tale of a mage who became obsessed with the study of Vampirism, desiring to create a controlled form of the disease. It is intended for players who enjoy Vampirism but get easily annoyed with the effects of not feeding every 24 hours. A series of clues will lead you across Cyrodiil in search of this mad mage's creations.<br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/6779" target="_blank">Damarask</a> by Polycrates</h4>
        <p>This mod contains a complete Dremora city in the Oblivion planes as well as an extensive questline. The city contains: a number of private residences, a council hall/museum, a smithy, an alchemist's, a Xivilai ice mage's dwelling, an arena/bloodworks, a temple to Dagon, a bar, guard towers, a barracks, the home of a particularly unhinged individual, slave caverns, and a massive apartment-type building. There's 50-odd NPCs, with AI schedules and a fair amount of unique dialogue (all unvoiced). There's a separate and ruthless criminal justice system. It includes 10 quests, as well as a large number of fights in the pit of the Damarask arena.<br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.elderscrolls.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=570159" target="_blank">The Naked Nord</a> by Hrreg</h4>
        <p>A naked Nord has been imprisoned in the Leyawiin Castle dungeon. He asks you to retrieve his hammer, stolen from him by a beautiful witch. It seems an easy enough task, but appearances can be deceiving... (inspired by a similar quest in Morrowind). This mod adds more than half a dozen new quests, complete with new NPCs and interiors.<br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/7079" target="_blank">Artefacts of the Ancestors</a> by Thunderbird1000</h4>
        <p>This is a big quest mod. It includes more than 30 quest stages, introduced through a mysterious book in the "First Edition". The mod includes new armors and weapons (with new meshes/textures), two new (optional) horse armor retextures, five new dungeons, many new creatures with new textures, voice-acted dialog (optional), and more. If you want to play without the voice-acted dialog, you'll need to install a separate version of the ESP file after you install the main download. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/7081" target="_blank">ESP with no voice-acting</a>.<br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/7636" target="_blank">Romancing Ahnassi</a> by Ilseroth</h4>
        <p>This is another quest mod disguised as a companion mod. Ahnassi has moved to Cyrodil and is alone and looking for friends. If you choose to help her and become her very special friend she may even invite you back to her house which she will share with you. Inspired by the Morrowind character and quests of the same name, this mod involves a series of quests to make you share a special bond. After you are finished with the quests, Ahnassi will become a full companion, willing to help you with whatever you need to do. Also, she will have special things to say and do on specific occasions and/or in certain places during your adventures together (think shopping!). For cat lovers.<br>

        <h4><a href="http://byblos.2.forumer.com/index.php?showtopic=245" target="_blank">Artifacts of Tamriel 300</a> by Marine OKeefe, Cleitanious, Modder 300, ByblosHex</h4>
        <p>This mod adds many classic TES artifacts to Oblivion. The book "Tamrielic Lore" tells of the greatest known artifacts and relics of Tamriel, along with hints as to their locations. Be wary, however, as the current owners of these mighty items are not going to hand them over without a fight. Each weapon and armor has its own new models, textures and icons. Their powers and stats are the same as found in the previous Elder Scrolls games. They include such famous items as the Bipolar Blade, the Fang of Haynekhtnament, the Ice Blade of the Monarch, the Mace of Slurring, Chrysamere, Eleidon's Ward, the Fists of Randagulf, the Lord's Mail, Ten Pace Boots, the Dragonbone Armor, and Gambolpuddy.<br>
