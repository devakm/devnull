        <h2>SMALL QUEST MOD LIST</h2>

        <p>These mods may be small, but they add a huge amount of quality to the game.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/7013" target="_blank">Weapons of the Nine</a> by Painkiller_Rider</h4>
        <p><i>Updated 7/8/2007!</i> This mod adds a small quest to recover a unique set of armor inspired by Morrowind. An extremely gifted Nord smith, Smerte Morder, traveled the world, seeking to hone his skills. He spent a long time in Morrowind as an apprentice to a Dunmer smith. But when the Dunmer realized the true extent of Smerte's talent, he was jealous and cast Smerte out. Seeking refuge at a holy shrine, Smerte was visited by the Nine Divines, who showed him deep secrets unknown to any other. This mod adds 11 new weapons and a full set of armor, all inspired by Morrowind-style Ebony. The weapons are for sale in Smerte's smithy, but he may also task you with a quest to recover his lost holy armor. <i>The Version 2.2 update adds a new shield, improves the armor textures, tweaks a few things, and fixes a bug.</i><br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/8613" target="_blank">Enter the Shinobi</a> by Coors916</h4>
        <p>This mod is not exactly lore-friendly, but it does make a creative effort to explain the existence of Ninjas in Cyrodiil, and it does a great job of adding Ninja-style adventure to Oblivion with a very tough quest. Designed to be played with a new character, the story starts when you first create your character (includes a new Ninja class you can play). Be warned that it will take some time to complete the quest this way since you will almost certainly be too weak to finish the mission at a low level (you can also tackle the quest with an existing character). Includes new Ninja-themed weapons, armor, and spells. The quest involves a new location -- "The Forgotten Shrine of Shinobi" -- which acts as a sort of obstacle course full of puzzles, traps, and dangerous enemies intent on keeping you from completing the mission. No voice acting. Highly recommended for Ninja fans, but probably not for lore-freaks.<br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/10740" target="_blank">Arrows of the Ayleid King</a> by FlyFightFlea, Hobbs, and Nicoroshi</h4>
        <p>This small quest mod packs a serious punch. Designed for higher level characters, the quest will send you on a journey into the tomb of an Ayleid king to find the long lost secret of crafting a variety of powerful magic arrows. The mod features great voice acting, new custom creatures to battle, a unique boss fight, and cinematic cutscenes. The arrows themselves provide great new gameplay options by using a variety of custom-scripted AOE magical effects that can be used on your enemies and also the physical environment (walls, ground, ceiling, etc.). It includes new arrow model/textures and, perhaps best of all, finally provides a worthwhile use for Ayleid Welkynd stones!<br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/7633" target="_blank">Weapons of the Fallen Hero</a> by Painkiller_Rider</h4>
        <p><i>Updated 3/7/2007</i>. This is a small mod inspired by LOTR, but integrated into TES lore. It tells a story of heroes and their long lost legendary weapons. For even the mightiest of the Heroes can fall under a rain of arrows and even the sharpest of weapons can be conquered by treachery. And so it happens that a boat bearing the breathless body of a Fallen Hero stopped on the shores of Cyrodiil. His life must have been a great one, as the wind knows of it, but will tell the story only to the worthy one. <i>The version 1.2 update is important because it removes some "dirty" references that might prevent other mods from working correctly, and it also makes the quest a lot more fun because the battles are now very fast-paced (the enemies have lower health but do more damage). Yes!</i><br>

        <h4><a href="#" title="Elder Scrolls Forums no longer exists - site was shut down" style="text-decoration: line-through; cursor: not-allowed;">Dexwood's Hideout</a> by Berzdex</h4>
        <p>This small mod adds three fully voice-acted quests. The action starts with a quest to gain a small but very useful hideout in the Imperial City Waterfront area. The other two quests follow success in the first quest. To get started, visit the Imperial City Waterfront and look for Charles Dexwood.<br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/7733" target="_blank">Spear of Bitter Mercy OBSE</a> by flyfightflea, opti, takes not needs</h4>
        <p>This mod adds the Spear of Bitter Mercy from the Morrowind Sheogorath Daedric quest to Oblivion. It includes a challenging quest with a special boss at the end, a unique Spear of Bitter Mercy model and texture made by opti, the Fork of Horripilation with a new model and texture, a new cavern with some interesting challenges and treasure, and much more. The mod uses <a href="http://obse.silverlock.org/" target="_blank">OBSE</a> to create a special combat system for the spear. This quest is made for high-level players, so do not attempt the quest until you are at least level 25+. To begin the quest, go to Sheogorath's shrine. Requires OBSE!<br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/7326" target="_blank">Daedric Recon</a> by MentalElf</h4>
        <p>This small voice-acted quest mod works really well during the Oblivion main quest. You discover the Imperial City has been targeted by Daedric forces. Now you will be the first to find their recon team and defend the city! An ancient Dwemer artifact has been discovered and it will be your weapon against the daedric infiltrators, provided you can figure out how to use it. The main draw is getting to shoot down Daedric airships with a Dwemer cannon, but the mod does also add some lore about the invasion. To start, find Scarlet Brimstone, a Breton Legion spellsword, in the Elven Gardens district of Imperial City.<br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/6454" target="_blank">Brew House</a> by axy</h4>
        <p>Although this mod doesn't add any major quests, it's a great way to add non-violent roleplaying opportunities to Oblivion. Brew House lets you buy a farm outside Anvil, get a farmhouse built (complete with personal bar and secret brewing room), buy your own lake, raise sheep and fish (and harvest their wool, scales and fish meat for a profit), plant and grow hops and grapes and brew your own beer and wine, ferment the wine longer to make more expensive, finer wine, buy a rare black sheep, etc. It also creates an alternative source of income besides selling weapons and armor, as well as providing a use for all those rakes, hoes, shovels, and shears you find.<br>

        <h4><b>Ash's Legend of Kah'Lil</b> by ash1967</h4>
        <p>This mod adds a new quest for members of the Dark Brotherhood. It tells the story of an old legend about the bones of one of the greatest assassins of the Dark Brotherhood, Kah'Lil. This quest begins when you find a note in the DB sanctuary living quarters left by your fellow assassin Emara. She has found a clue suggesting that the legend may have been more than just a story.<br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/5751" target="_blank">A Change in Management</a> by StingingVelvet</h4>
        <p>Somewhere in Bravil, a scared Khajit woman needs your help. This small but excellent quest mod has the perfect Elder Scrolls feel to it. Some questionable business is being conducted "under the table" in Bravil, and now it seems that murder will surely result. After you finish this mod, you may need to disable it to avoid a very strange bug that can cause creatures and NPCs in unrelated areas to get "stuck" when trying to move.<br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/5313" target="_blank">Markov Manor</a> by Valkyrie and The Rangers Guild</h4>
        <p>Unravel the secrets of a mysterious dwelling. This quest mod focuses on a certain house with an interesting and dark backstory, including the complete first chapter of the Chronicles of Cryofax and other books/notes. Other features include a new place to live and store items that is functional and interesting, many new textures, a new set of robes, quest rewards that don't break the game but are worth it, Spellmaking and Enchanting Altars you can use if you don't want to join the Mages Guild just to access them, as well as the ability to roleplay a new class of character. The quest begins once you fall asleep in a bed. Don't rely on the quest marker, though, since it will only point you to the general area where the manor is.<br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/7514" target="_blank">Last Unicorn</a> by Geniel</h4>
        <p>This mod finally adds a good-guy option to Hircine's quest. If you worship the Nine, and have done good deeds, you may be able to tame the Last Unicorn. A priest of the Nine guards the Unicorn in Harcane Grove, and when you approach he will tell you all you need to know. If you manage to tame him, the Unicorn will be a swift steed, and will fight your foes fiercely. But beware, he is not invulnerable. If you fail to complete the task the old priest gives you, the Last Unicorn can be slain. But if you persevere, he will never fade from the world, and will be faithful to you as long as you remain steadfast to the Nine. The mod includes voice acting by the Oblivion Voice Actors Guild, a new book about the Unicorn, and meshes and textures from Slof's Horses.<br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/4969" target="_blank">Ungarion's Memoirs Part 1: The Welkynd Sword</a> by MadCat221</h4>
        <p>This mod tells the story of the retired adventurer Ungarion, proprietor of Bravil's "A Warlock's Luck" magic emporium. It seems that Aeons ago, an ancient Nenalatan champion warrior was bestowed with a gift from his king: a magical sword with shining Welkynd stones embedded within its arcane meteoric iron core. Help Ungarion fulfill his dream of recovering the ancient Ayleid relic from the depths of forgotten history!<br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/7825" target="_blank">The Gift of Kynareth</a> by Painkiller_Rider</h4>
        <p>This small mod tells the story of Morihaus, Taker of the Citadel and lover of Alessia and how he lost his friend Pelinal Whitestrake during the siege of the White Tower. You must search for the hidden Mausoleum of Morihaus and attempt to gain entry to it.<br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/7604" target="_blank">Druids' Guild</a> by Jnor de Kernier</h4>
        <p>There is a new guild that just started in Cyrodiil: the Druids Guild. If you wish to join, you will have to fight hordes of pyromaniacs and hunters. However, you'll have allies to help you in some fights. In the course of the missions, you will purchase guildhalls to expand the guild. The mod includes four quests, three new classes, two new birthsigns, more than 10 NPCs with complete AI, and two guildhalls. The guildhall is close to the Mephala Shrine, in the Heartlands. Updates are ongoing and the final version will include a massive battle involving the guild members and a hunting party.<br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/8714" target="_blank">The Old Crow Inn</a> by Confidence Man</h4>
        <p>Near the shrine of Clavicus Vile rests the Old Crow Inn, a downtrodden establishment with a dark secret hidden beneath the surface. This mod adds two quests, NPCs, a basement home for the player, new weapons and items (no new meshes/textures though), dungeons, and several other locations of interest. The quests are designed for higher level players. The bosses are not scaled, and may be quite tough (or near-impossible) for low-level players.<br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/6324" target="_blank">Temple of the Full/New Moon</a> by Ilseroth</h4>
        <p>This mod contains both the <i>Temple of the Full Moon</i> and the expansion, the <i>Temple of the New Moon</i>. Both mods focus on hand-to-hand combat and are designed to let you finally play as a hand-to-hand combat character as much as you want. It includes a new sect you can join and eventually become the leader by honing your hand-to-hand skills. Other features include your own personal quarters once you are master, a questline to complete once your the master, seven combatants you can rematch whenever you want (if you let them live), four hardened warriors protecting a secret, and a new enchanted item that will only be useful to a master hand-to-hand fighter.<br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/7902" target="_blank">Vampire Clan Raelu</a> by thePOSTALdude</h4>
        <p>Although this mod is part of a larger project, Modular Oblivion Enhanced (MOE), it can be downloaded separately and used without the rest of MOE. This mod provides the storyline and quests for a new vampire clan, complete with its own unique vampires and cattle NPCs, schedules, spoken dialogue, a birthsign for each NPC, headquarters, ranks, and rules of conduct and admission. Also adds new spells, a unique type of moon sugar, a clan book, two Morrowind books on vampires, working blood vials and new treasures to discover. You must become a vampire to start the quest. You'll be contacted by clan Raelu a few days later in your sleep.<br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/3415" target="_blank">The Storyteller's Brother</a> by DeadlyAccurate</h4>
        <p>Magdinio the Storyteller needs your help to recover an item of great personal value to him. This is a small quest, but it includes good voice acting by the Voice Actors Guild. Be sure to install the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/7809" target="_blank">quest fix</a> after installing the main download.<br>

        <h4><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/6846" target="_blank">The Halls of the Phoenix Order</a> by Pekka</h4>
        <p>Evil Deadra still threaten Cyrodiil. The Book of Flames, found in the Cheydinhal Mage's Guild, tells of a forgotten dungeon known as <i>The Halls of the Phoenix Order</i>. This small quest mod is mostly a dungeon romp for high-level characters, but handy if you need Fire Salts after closing the Oblivion Gates.<br>
