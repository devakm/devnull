      <h3>Slof's Playable Xivilai for OOO</h3>
      <p>MadCat221 has made a modified version of <strong>Slof's Playable Xivilai</strong> plugin to act as an NPC replacer for all instances of creature Xivilai in the gameworld for OOO. Leveled creature lists, Summon spells, Anaxes and Medrike in Camoran's Paradise, even the Sanguine Rose are all replaced with NPC Xivilai of both male and female varieties. Note that you must download and install the content files in the base Playable Xivilai mod first for it to function. The OOO version is a replacement ESP, containing the Xivilai race data in the original plugin, as well as the added leveled creature list changes, and alterations made to the Camoran's Paradise quest concerning all the quest hooks for Anaxes and Medrike.<br>
