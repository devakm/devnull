      <p>Oscuro's Oblivion Overhaul 137 has arrived.</p>
      <p>Oscuro's Oblivion Overhaul aims to make Oblivion a much more interesting, challenging, realistic and dangerous place, and also offers great rewards for the daring adventurer regardless of your level. </p>
      <p>You must be prepared to cast aside your previous notions about Cyrodiil. The world no longer revolves around you, the player. Do not expect to be able to beat every monster or NPC you meet. Previously familiar areas may now be much more dangerous and you will frequently be forced to retreat from enemies who are too powerful to beat until you are stronger. You will probably die a lot more often now. However, if you have the ingenuity, skill, and luck to survive the odds stacked against you, then you will be justly rewarded for your bravery!</p>

      <p>If you want to get up and running with OOO as quickly and painlessly as possible, then you've come to the right place! </p>
      <a name="Download"></a>
      <h3> Downloads </h3>
      <p>Start with the standalone EXE installer <b>Complete</b> package and then add the <b>Patch</b>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Get both the <b>OOO 136 Complete BSA Installer EXE</b> and the <b>OOO 137 Patch</b> from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/15256?tab=files" target="_blank">NexusMods</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Run the Installer first, then extract the Patch and install it as well, overwriting the ESM and ESP files from the previous install.</p>
      <p>If you want or need one of the older versions, these are also available at the same NexusMods link. Download either the Complete or Upgrade version, depending on what you already have. The older options include OMOD conversion data with an install script that guides you through the install process and option choices. This is the recommended install method.</p>
      <p>The older upgrade versions require a prior install of OOO 1.3 Base. You've been warned!</p>

      <a name="UpgReq"></a>
      <h3> Complete Install Requirements </h3>
      <p>To use <strong>OOO 1.3.7</strong>, you'll need two downloads to get everything working correctly. Here are the basic requirements: </p>
      <ol>
        <li> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/15256?tab=files" target="_blank">OOO 136 Complete BSA Installer EXE</a></li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/15256?tab=files" target="_blank">OOO 137 Patch</a></li>
        <li> Approximately 1Gb of free disk space.</li>
        <li> A decent computer. If your system is already struggling to run Oblivion, then you probably don't want to try OOO 1.3.7. If you also use any large texture replacers, such as QTP3, then you'll probably need at least 2Gb of RAM and a 512Mb video card.</li>
        <li> If you previously used any of the RC3 or RC5 hotfix plugins, you should remove them after installing 1.3.7.
          All of the RC3/RC5 hotfixes and changes from 1.32.Final have been integrated into 1.33 and later versions. Also
          check the list of <a href="OOO_Problems132RC5.html" target="_blank">Known Issues With OOO 132RC5</a> for help with any other potential problems.</li>
        <li> Nerves of steel. OOO makes the game deadly!</li>
      </ol>
      <p> If you're having trouble downloading the large base file, please read <a href="http://cs.elderscrolls.com/constwiki/index.php/Oblivion_Mods_FAQ#How_do_I_avoid_corrupt_downloads.3F" target="_blank">How do I avoid corrupt downloads</a>.</p>
      <p> The <b>1.3.3 Complete</b> package can be installed over any existing OOO 1.3x installation. It
        doesn't matter whether you have any of the previous upgrades or patches, but you must <a href="#upSave">update any existing savegames</a> with Wrye Bash or the included OOOupsave.exe. </p>
      <p> You should also take some time to read through the updated <a href="https://github.com/devakm/devnull/raw/main/docs/OOO/OOO_134_readme.pdf" target="_blank">OOO 1.34 Readme</a> (PDF) and the list of <a href="OOO_Changelog_FAQ.html#OOO133">OOO 1.33.Final Changes</a> (updated for 1.32.Final). You've been warned. </p>
      <p>Alternately, if you already have the <b>1.32.Final Complete</b> package, you can make your own <strong>1.33 Complete</strong> by combining <b>1.32.Final Complete</b> with the <strong>1.33 Patch</strong>, in which case you need: </p>
      <ol>
        <li><em>OOO 1.32.Final Complete</em> from <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/oscuros-oblivion-overhaul/addons/oscuro-s-oblivion-overhaul-1-32-final-full-version" target="_blank">ModDB</a> or <a href="https://github.com/devakm/devnull/raw/main/docs/OOO/OOO_132f_Complete.7z" target="_blank">GitHub</a></li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/15256?tab=files " target="_blank">OOO 1.33 Patch</a></li>
      </ol>
      <p>For more upgrade alternatives, see <a href="#OOO133PatchAlt">Alternate Install Combos</a>. </p>

      <a name="OOO133Patch"></a>
      <h3>Patch Upgrade from Older Versions to 133</h3>
      <p>To use the <b>OOO 1.33 Patch </b>, you'll need at least two separate downloads to get everything working correctly. These are: </p>
      <ol>
        <li><em>OOO 1.32.Final Complete</em> from <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/oscuros-oblivion-overhaul/addons/oscuro-s-oblivion-overhaul-1-32-final-full-version" target="_blank">ModDB</a> or <a href="https://github.com/devakm/devnull/raw/main/docs/OOO/OOO_132f_Complete.7z" target="_blank">GitHub</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://files.filefront.com/OOO+132f+Complete7z/;9620325;/fileinfo.html" target="_blank">OOO 1.32.Final Complete</a> or the same effect using the <a href="#mirrors">OOO 1.3 Base Install</a> plus the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/15256?tab=files" target="_blank">OOO 1.32.Final Upgrade</a>. </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/15256?tab=files" target="_blank">OOO 1.33 Patch</a>.
          If you get the standard 7zip archive, then you can do either a manual install or a scripted OMOD install (omod conversion data is included). The OMOD method is recommended, but if you don't use OBMM then there's a separate standalone EXE installer package you can use instead. </li>
        <li> It's a good idea to make your own OMOD of <strong>OOO 1.33 Complete</strong>. You can do this yourself by extracting both archives to a temporary location and then just dropping the files from <strong>1.33 Patch</strong> over the ones from <strong>1.32.Final Complete</strong> before you build your OMOD. Be sure to include the omod conversion data when you do this and then when you create the OMOD be sure to add the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/12876" target="_blank">Official OOO 1.33 OMOD installation script update</a>. This will effectively give you <strong>1.32.FinalComplete+1.33Patch</strong> as a single OMOD. </li>
        <li>Check the list of <a href="OOO_Problems132RC5.html" target="_blank">Known Issues With OOO 1.32RC5</a> for help with any other potential problems.</li>
      </ol>
      <p> The <b>1.33 Patch</b> can only be installed over a complete or upgraded 1.32.Final install.</p>
      <a name="OOO133PatchAlt"></a>
      <h3>Alternate Install Combos</h3>
      <p>Many OOO players have some prior updates and don't want to download the large <b>OOO 1.33 Complete</b>. Alternate upgrade paths are not recommended, but they will work in a pinch. There are four ways to get the same results as 1.33 Complete. These are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>1.33 Complete.</li>
        <li>1.32.Final Complete + 1.33 Patch</li>
        <li>1.3 Base + 1.32.Final Upgrade + 1.33 Patch</li>
        <li>1.3 Base + 1.32.RC3 + Hotfix06 + 1.33 Patch (but be sure to remove the hotfix plugins afterward)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>All of the above upgrade methods will produce the same end result (a working install of OOO 1.33).</p>
      <h3>Upgrade Install Requirements </h3>
      <p>Rather than provide details on all of the above methods, let's just focus on #3. To use the <b>OOO 1.32.Final Upgrade</b>, you'll need three separate downloads to get everything working correctly. These are: </p>
      <ol>
        <li> <a href="#mirrors">OOO 1.3 Base Install</a> (available from multiple sites -- roughly 400Mb) </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/15256?tab=files" target="_blank">OOO 1.32.Final Upgrade</a>.
          If you get the standard 7zip archive, then you can do either a manual
          install or a scripted OMOD install (omod conversion data is included).
          The OMOD method is recommended, but if you don't use OBMM then there's
          a separate standalone EXE installer package you can use instead. </li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/15256?tab=files" target="_blank">OOO 1.33 Patch</a>.</li>
        <li> If you previously used any of the RC3 or RC5 hotfix plugins, you should
          remove them after installing 1.32.Final. All of the RC3/RC5 hotfixes
          have been integrated into 1.32.Final . See <a href="OOO_Changelog_FAQ.html#Final">Final Changes</a>. </li>
        <li>Check the list of <a href="http://devnull.sweetdanger.net/oooproblems.html" target="_blank">Known Issues With OOO 1.32</a> for help with any other potential problems.</li>
      </ol>
      <p> The <b>1.32.Final Upgrade</b> can be installed over any existing OOO 1.3x installation. It doesn't
        matter whether you have any of the previous upgrades or patches, but <b>you must install the OOO 1.3 base package</b> (see #1 bove) before adding the 1.32.Final Upgrade, and you must <a href="#upSave">update any existing savegames</a> with the included OOOupsave.exe and/or Wrye Bash. </p>
      <p>The <b>1.33 Patch</b> can only be installed over a complete or upgraded <strong>1.32.Final</strong> install. The <b>1.33 Patch</b> does not include any of the required base resource files (meshes, textures, etc.), only the upgraded plugins. </p>
      <p>If
        you downloaded the standalone EXE installer, then just launch it and
        follow the prompts to pick which options you want. Once it finishes,
        you must follow the <a href="#post">Post-Install</a> instructions. Otherwise, see the OMOD or Manual Install section first. </p>

      <a name="omodup"></a>
      <h4> OMOD Upgrade or OMOD Complete Install </h4>
      <ol type="1">
        <li> If you're using the Upgrade package and have not already installed the
          1.3 Base files, you must do this first. Extract the 1.3 Base files to a
          temporary folder, then copy or move them into your <font face="courier new,monospace" size="2">\Oblivion\Data\</font> folder. When prompted to "<i>Allow Overwrite?</i>", click "<i>Yes to All</i>". </li>
        <li> If you did not download <strong>OOO 1.33 Complete</strong>, then it's a good idea to make your own OMOD of <strong>OOO 1.33 Complete</strong>. You can do this yourself by extracting the archives for <strong>1.32.Final Complete</strong> and the <strong>1.33 Patch</strong> to a temporary location and then just dropping the files from <strong>1.33 Patch</strong> over the ones from <strong>1.32.Final Complete</strong> before you build your OMOD. Be sure to include the omod conversion data when you do this and then when you create the OMOD be sure to add the <a href="http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=12876" target="_blank">Official OOO 1.33 OMOD installation script update</a>. This will effectively give you <strong>1.32.FinalComplete+1.33Patch</strong> as a single OMOD. </li>
        <li> Launch Oblivion Mod Manager (OBMM) and click on the <b>Create</b> button at the bottom of the OBMM screen.<br>
        </li>
        <li> Now you have a choice. You can either:
          <ul>
            <li>Click <b>Add Archive</b> and select the <strong>OOO 1.33 Complete</strong> archive -- or whichever of the OOO archives you downloaded (i.e., either <strong>OOO_132f_UPGRADE.7z</strong> or <strong>OOO_132f_Complete.7z</strong>) </li>
            <li>Or, you can click <b>Add Folder </b> and select the custom <strong>1.32.FinalComplete+1.33Patch</strong> folder you made in Step #2.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Answer <b>Yes</b> to any question prompts. </li>
        <li> Now all of the necessary fields will be filled in for you. </li>
        <li> Click <b>Create omod</b> and wait a while for it to complete. </li>
        <li> Activate the Oscuro's Oblivion Overhaul OMOD you created and follow the
          install prompts to pick which options you want installed. </li>
        <li> Follow the <a href="#post">Post-Install</a> instructions. </li>
      </ol>
      <p><a href="#top">� BACK TO THE TOP</a></p>
      <a name="manup"></a>
      <h4> Manual Upgrade or Manual Complete Install </h4>
      <ol type="1">
        <li> If you're using the Upgrade package and have not already installed the
          OOO 1.3 Base files, you must do this first. Extract the 1.3 Base files
          to a temporary folder, then copy or move them into your <font face="courier new,monospace">\Oblivion\Data\</font> folder. When prompted to "<i>Allow Overwrite?</i>", click "<i>Yes to All</i>". </li>
        <li> Extract the <strong>1.33 Complete</strong> archive to a temporary folder, then copy or move them into your <font face="courier new,monospace">\Oblivion\Data\</font> folder. When prompted to "<i>Allow Overwrite?</i>", click "<i>Yes to All</i>". </li>
        <li> Or, instead of #2, extract the <strong>1.32.Final</strong> archive (Upgrade or Complete) and the <strong>1.33 Patch</strong> archive to a temporary folder. Make sure the 1.33 Patch files replace the 1.32 files. Now copy or move them into your <font face="courier new,monospace">\Oblivion\Data\</font> folder. When prompted to "<i>Allow Overwrite?</i>", click "<i>Yes to All</i>". </li>
        <li>Activate both the ESM and the ESP files (<i>Oscuro's_Oblivion_Overhaul.esm</i> and <i>Oscuro's_Oblivion_Overhaul.esp</i>).
          The Full Version and Lite Version are both included in the download.
          The Full Version is installed by default. If you want to use the Lite
          Version instead of the Full Version (default), then also copy the ESP
          file from the <font face="courier new,monospace" size="2">\Oscuro's Oblivion Overhaul\OOO-LITE\</font> folder, replacing the default <i>Oscuro's_Oblivion_Overhaul.esp </i> (which is the Full Version ESP). </li>
        <li> Activate any optional plugins you want to use. See the <a href="https://github.com/devakm/devnull/raw/main/docs/OOO/OOO_134_readme.pdf" target="_blank">OOO 1.34 Readme PDF</a> for a complete summary of the available choices in 1.32.Final. An
          incomplete summary of the option files can also be found on the <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion_Mod:Oscuro%27s_Oblivion_Overhaul/Installation">Oscuro Installation</a> page. The option files can be found in the <font face="courier new,monospace" size="2">\Oscuro's Oblivion Overhaul\OOO-ADD-ONS\</font> folder. </li>

      <a name="post"></a>
      <h4> Post-Install </h4>
      <ol type="1">
        <li> If you're planning to use an existing savegame, you'll need to update your savegame with <b>Wrye Bash v118 or later</b>. There are two parts to this step, so be sure to read though the next two steps carefully. </li>
        <li> If you're upgrading from 1.3 or 1.31 to 1.32 for the first time, then
          you must alter the master dependency for OOO in your savegame to avoid
          losing any items you may have gained from previous versions (you only
          need to do this once when you first switch from 1.3 or 1.31 to 1.32,
          not when switching from a previous version of 1.32 to 1.32.Final ). See <a href="#upSave">Update Savegames</a> for details on how to do this with Wrye Bash. Alternately, you can use the included OOOupsave.exe and follow the prompts.<br>
        </li>
        <li> If you're adding OOO 1.32 to a savegame that previously did not use OOO
          (even if it was just created in the starter dungeon before adding OOO)
          , then you'll need to use Wrye Bash to <i>Update NPC Levels</i> on your savegame. See <a href="#upSave">Update Savegames</a> for details on how to do this<b>. </b><i><br>
          </i> </li>
        <li> If
          you are upgrading a current
          savegame from OOO 1.3, you MUST take off any cape you may be wearing
          (or carrying) that you got from an NPC -- except guard capes -- and
          throw them away before you load your save with 1.32. If you are
          not sure where you got a cape, the safest route is to drop it into an
          empty container, save, install 1.32, then load and see if your cape is
          still in the container. If it's still there, then it should be safe to
          use. If you don't follow these instructions, you may get stuck with a cape that cannot be unequipped. </li>
        <li> If you are upgrading a current savegame from OOO 1.3, you'll need to
          enter a console command to enable the lockpicking restrictions. You need to type the following in the console (~):<br>
          <br>
          <font face="courier new,monospace" size="2">Set LapMinLock to 1</font> <br>
          <br>
          After doing this, save the game and reload. See <a href="#ingame">In-Game Options</a> for details.<br>
        </li>
        <li> If you use a <a href="https://wrye-bash.github.io/docs/Wrye%20Bash%20General%20Readme.html#patch">Bashed Patch</a> (a highly recommended feature of Wrye Bash), be sure to update it after
          upgrading to 1.32.Final . Otherwise Oblivion may not launch. To do
          this, right-click the Bashed Patch in Wrye Bash and select <i>Rebuild Patch</i> (called <i>Update Patch</i> in older versions of Wrye Bash).<br>
        </li>
        <li> Launch the game, load your save, then open the console (~) and execute the following commands:<br>
          <br>
          <font face="courier new,monospace" size="2">Set OOOFishSpawn to 0</font><br>
          <br>
          (This step is not necessary if you start a new game after loading 1.32.Final.) See <a href="#ingame">In-Game Options</a> for details. <br>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <a name="upSave"></a>
      <h4> Update Savegames</h4>
      <p>To to avoid losing stuff from OOO 1.3 or 1.31, you must update your savegames </p>
      <p> <i>This
          only applies if you've already been playing OOO 1.3 or 1.31 for a while
          and have accumulated a bunch of stuff from OOO that you want to keep.</i> </p>
      <p> Run the <strong>OOOupsave.exe</strong> included with the 1.32.Final download and follow the prompts, or use <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/591" target="_blank">Wrye Bash</a>. </p>
      <p>To use <strong>Wrye Bash</strong>, you must first download and install it. Once you get it working, follow these steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Launch Wrye Bash. </li>
        <li>Go to the <strong>saves</strong> tab. </li>
        <li>Select a savegame you want to fix (one made before the update). </li>
        <li>Click on that savegame. </li>
        <li>Look in the lower-right
          corner at the <strong>masters list</strong>. </li>
        <li>Find <i>Oscuro's_Oblivion_Overhaul.esp</i>. </li>
        <li>Click inside the text and edit it to say <i>Oscuro's_Oblivion_Overhaul.es<b>m</b></i> (i.e., just change the final "<b>p</b>" to "<b>m</b>"), </li>
        <li>Alternately, you can right-click where it says <em>Oscuro's_Oblivion_Overhaul.esp</em> and select <i>Change To</i>, then browse to <i>Oscuro's_Oblivion_Overhaul.esm</i> and select it -- or simply change the ".esp" part of the filename to ".esm". </li>
        <li>The masters list will now be updated to swap <i>Oscuro's_Oblivion_Overhaul.es<strong>p</strong></i> for <i>Oscuro's_Oblivion_Overhaul.es<strong>m</strong></i>. </li>
        <li>Finally, you must click the <i>Save</i> button at the bottom of the masters list to save the change. </li>
        <li>Now, quit Wrye Bash, load Oblivion with that savegame and you're good to go.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Update NPC Levels</h4>
      <p>Using <i>Update NPC Levels</i> on your savegame will ensure that NPC stats are set properly for OOO. <i>Update NPC Levels</i> is also a good idea (but not required) when updating a 1.32 savegame to 1.32.Final . </p>
      <p>In Wrye Bash:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select the Saves tab. </li>
        <li>Right-click on a savegame. </li>
        <li>Select <i>Update NPC Levels. </i></li>
      </ul>
      <p>All of the mods in your load order will be examined and the proper changes will be made to your savegame. <b>Be sure to use Wrye Bash v118 or later when doing this.</b> </p>

      <h2> Hints &amp; Spoilers </h2>
      <p> Many players find OOO 1.3 overwhelming. If you're having trouble making a character that can survive this harsh new world, read the character creation guidelines. Includes suggestions for finding a good starter dungeon and much more. If you're having trouble finding everything OOO adds, check out the detailed spoilers. </p>

      <h2> Performance </h2>
      <p> OOO is a system-resource intensive mod. It may slow down your game. This will vary a lot depending on your system and it may also improve as you play the mod for a while. It's a good idea to have more than 1Gb of RAM (this would be a very old system by today's standards). If the performance hit is significant enough to be a problem for you, you can sometimes improve things by turning off the fish. See <a href="#ingame">In-Game Options</a> for details. This will have the biggest impact when you are near water. </p>

      <h2> In-Game Options </h2>
      <h4> In-Game Option Controls </h4>
      <p>OOO lets you set many in-game options using Oblivion console (~) commands. These are described separately below.</p>
      <p>However, if you don't like using the console then you can instead add the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/21104" target="_blank">Common Oblivion (Cobl)</a> mod, which includes a support file for OOO 1.32. Enabling the <strong>OOO 1.32-Cobl.esp</strong> plugin gives you a special inventory item called <strong>+[Options]</strong>. Clicking this item lets you set OOO options for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lock picking in combat. </li>
        <li>Lock picking skills requirements. </li>
        <li>Lock bash difficulty. </li>
        <li>Harvest containers. </li>
        <li>Add/Remove torch hotkey. </li>
        <li>Disable/Enable Geomancy.</li>
        <li>Disable/Enable Fish spawns. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> Here's what each of these options does (along with the console command for it). </p>
      <h4> Fish </h4>
      <p> To disable the fish added by OOO, open the Oblivion console (~) and type: </p>
      <p>
        <font face="courier new,monospace" size="2"> Set OOOFishSpawn to 0 </font>
      </p>
      <h4> Lockpicking Restrictions </h4>
      <p> If you don't like the lockpicking skill restrictions, you can disable it with the console (~) command:</p>
      <p>
        <font face="courier new,monospace" size="2">Set LapMinLock to 0 </font>
      </p>
      <p> If you don't like the "no lockpicking during combat" restrictions, you can disable it with the console: </p>
      <p>
        <font face="courier new,monospace" size="2">Set LapNoCombatLock to 0</font>
      </p>
      <p> After doing this, save the game and reload. </p>
      <h4> Lock Bashing </h4>
      <p> If you don't like the lock bash difficulty, you can make it dramatically easier with the console command: </p>
      <p>
        <font face="courier new,monospace" size="2">Set LapBashLockDifficulty to 0 </font>
      </p>
      <p> Or:</p>
      <p>
        <font face="courier new,monospace" size="2">Set LapBashLockDifficulty to -110</font>
      </p>
      <p>Lock bash cannot be turned off completely. </p>
      <h3> Harvest Containers </h3>
      <p> You can disable container animations using the Oblivion console (in OOO 1.32 RC3 or later). There are several options for this:<br>
        <br>
        <b>Turn off HC for player house containers:</b> <span style="font-family: Courier New;">Set OOOHCPlayerHouse to 0</span><br>
        <b>Turn off HC for chests, cupboards, desks, drawers and lecterns:</b> <span style="font-family: Courier New;">Set OOOHC to 0</span><br>
        <b>Turn off HC for barrels and crates:</b> <span style="font-family: Courier New;">Set OOOHCBarrelsAndCrates to 0</span><br>
        <b>Turn off HC for sacks:</b> <span style="font-family: Courier New;">Set OOOHCSacks to 0</span>
      </p>
      <h3> Armor Disposition</h3>
      <p>In 1.32.Final, the armor disposition system is completely disabled.</p>
