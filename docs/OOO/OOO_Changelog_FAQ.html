    <h2 id="pageName">Introduction</h2>

    <div class="story">

      <p>The development of Oscuro's Oblivion Overhaul has been ongoing for several years now, and has gone through many revisions.
        The 1.32 release in particular took a very long time to complete. This was due in part to real life distractions,
        but also the massive scope of what it attempted to accomplish.</p>

      <p>In
        fact, version 1.32 had multiple releases, each containing enough new
        features and fixes to warrant a separate version number of its own.
        This started with the 1.32 Open Beta. Then came Release Candidate 1
        (RC1), Release Candidate 2 (RC2), and finally Release Candidate 3
        (RC3). The RC4 version was never publicly released. Finally, after a
        long delay, we completed Release Candidate 5 (RC5). After some additional delays,
        we at long last released the 1.32.Final package. Sadly, as is so often the case,
        some last-minute improvements didn't work as well as we'd hoped, so we've now
        followed up with version 1.33 to correct those problems. Hopefully this will prove to be the
        most stable version yet.</p>

      <p>This
        document collects the Changelog information written by Sotobrastos for
        1.32.RC1 through 1.32.RC3, as well as the much shorter changelogs for 1.32.RC5, 1.32.Final, and 1.33.
        The information has been somewhat revised and edited for accuracy. I have
        also included an updated version of the original OOO 1.3 FAQ, which
        answers many common questions about the mod. Most of the information
        found here has now been integrated into the new <a href="https://github.com/devakm/devnull/raw/main/docs/OOO/OOO_134_readme.pdf" target="_blank">OOO 1.34 Readme (PDF)</a>,
        so that's the place to look for a coherent understanding of how OOO 1.32 works. Here you will
        instead find the "raw" information in its original sequential form.</p>

            explanation about using a Grass mod to help reduce crashes and terrible

            would like to start a new game with OOO 1.3, but I also wish to
            continue my heavily modded Oblivion I am still playing. Would a

            inventory ect. HELP my Char is literaly stuck in this cave!</a></li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Gameplay Problems &amp; Questions</h3>
      <ol>

        <li><a href="#c1">Torches appear as �Missing Name� in-game, what is up?</a></li>

        <li><a href="#c8">Does OOO work with the Unofficial Patch?</a></li>
        <li><a href="#c9">OMG, it takes forever to level up! What's wrong?</a></li>
        <li><a href="#c10">Wait, your supposed to load Living Economy *before* OOO? Ah, cripes. So the new load order is:</a></li>

        <li><a href="#c11">Since
            I am not a big fan of clothes/armour revealing three fourths of the
            body, I am wondering if it is possible to remove Growlf�s Female Armor
            sets from the mod? (I'm not trying to bash the creator, I just don't
            like "revealing" armour.)</a></li>
        <li><a href="#c12">At what point does one start to feel like they have a chance against anything but mud crabs and deer?</a></li>
        <li><a href="#c13">Does OOO alter anything in the Arena?</a></li>
        <li><a href="#c14">Are there random dangerous areas, or "static"? For instance will an area always contain high level creatures/loot?</a></li>
        <li><a href="#c15">How
            do you get your character to be on good terms with the new factions?
            i.e, my pc is a ranger and I would like it if the wolves etc would
            fight for him?</a></li>
        <li><a href="#c16">Can I use the mages guild storage boxes as storage without respawn?</a></li>

        <li><a href="#c17">Can I reduce the effectiveness of magic for armor users even further than it already is in OOO? If so, what variable is it?</a></li>
        <li><a href="#c18">The
            mage birthsign is supposed to give 30 magicka &amp; 1pt regeneration,
            but in the game i get 30 magicka &amp; +10 to willpower. So is +10 wp =
            1pt regen? Also, does the willpower bonus allow a char with the mage
            sign to reach 110 willpower ultimately?</a></li>
        <li><a href="#c19">Why are the harvest visual effects (plant removing/container opening) not showing?</a></li>
        <li><a href="#c20">Will cosmetic mods cause any problems?</a></li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Conflicts</h3>
      Even if your exact conflict issues are not listed here, reading
      this can give you an idea which sorts of things are significant and
      which ones can be ignored.<br>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="#d1">What are the conflicts with the Unofficial
            Oblivion Patch, Beautiful People, Living Economy and Mighty Magick? Are
            they drastic? Or can they be changed with load order?</a></li>
        <li><a href="#d2">Does
            anyone know why the saddlebags mod does not work with ooo 1.3? I
            changed the load order so the saddlebags mod loads last, but it still
            doesnt work.</a></li>
        <li><a href="#d3">Does anyone know if these conflicts are something I should be concerned about?</a><br>

        <li><a href="#d4">I
            really like no persistent glow and no more annoying messages. Do you
            think these conflicts are bad enough to cause the OOO 1.3 to not work
            properly?</a></li>

        <li><a href="#d7">I'm using AF level mod, and
            I've heard there is a compatibility problem with OOO 1.3. The problem
            is about health, then I've searched on the web to find an answer.
            Here's what I did: I use the CS, open OOO, go to gameplay, settings,
            find the fpchealthbasemult setting and write 2.0 instead of 1.5 in the
            box. This should resolve the problem with health. But, now, I don't
            know if I must load AF after or before OOO 1.3. Can anybody help me?</a></li>

      <p class="content_title_small"><b>I keep getting corrupt or incomplete downloads. How can I get this great mod?</b></p>
      <p>There
        are a lot of possible causes. The first thing to do is make sure you
        have enough free disk space on your boot drive and wherever you're
        saving the file.</p>
      <p><span>(from Phaedryn)</span> Also, be sure to check whether you are using Windows XP firewall or
        another firewall. If you are, you probably need to turn it off
        temporarily to download the file. NOT all firewalls will cause the
        problem, but some do, (it all depends on how severe the settings are).
        In my case, it is Nvidia's firewall that is associated to thier network
        manager setup that causes the problem. I simply turn it off for the
        duration of the download and it is fine.</p>

      <a name="a4" id="a4"></a>
      <p><b>What is the difference between OOO FULL and OOO LITE?</b></p>
      <p>OOO
        Full is the entire package-the whole caboodle, what I envisioned OOO to
        be. The OOO Lite is the OOO Full minus the sum of changes found in the
        OOO-ADD-ON folder�s ESPs. (<span class="warning">EXCEPT: Living Economy�Living Economy should be used with the Full version.</span> I left it out so that you could update the mod as CreepyFellow issues its latest versions.)</p>
      <p>This
        means that if you were to use the ESP inside the folder named OOO-LITE
        plus the ESPs found inside the folder named OOO-ADD-ON you would end up
        with the same result as if you used the Full version.</p>

      <p>Look in the <a href="https://github.com/devakm/devnull/raw/main/docs/OOO/OOO_134_readme.pdf" target="_blank">OOO 1.34 Readme (PDF)</a>
        for an explanation of what each of the OOO optional modules do.</p>
      <a href="#top">� BACK TO THE TOP</a><br>
      <br>
      <a name="a5" id="a5"></a>
      <p><b>There are a lot of mods in the OOO-ADD-ON folder. Which ones do I need?</b></p>

      <p>If you are using the Full version, you only need to enable the Living Economy ESP (which is the same as version 3.51 of LE)</p>
      <p>Harvest Flora is optional.</p>
      <p>Bofra�s
        Level_Rates_Modified ESPs are not needed, but you can use them to
        change the rate at which your character increases skill points. You
        only need to use one of these mods if you wish to change the OOO�s rate
        of skill progression (x2 means twice slower, x3 means thrice slower,
        etc, than in default Oblivion�OOO uses a x4 slower, but some skills are
        higher, some a bit lower.)</p>
      <p>Most other OOO optional ESPs is there to be used with the Lite version. You can use whichever of those you want.<br>
        <i><span>(note: Some of them will "conflict" with each other. This is expected and it is not a problem.)</span></i>

      <p><b>Is it possible to use OOO 1.3 with a previous save-game? If so, how?</b></p>
      <p>Yes. It's easy using <b>Wrye Bash</b>. See the <a href="https://github.com/devakm/devnull/raw/main/docs/OOO/OOO_134_readme.pdf" target="_blank">OOO 1.34 Readme (PDF)</a>

      <a name="b1" id="b1"></a>
      <p><b>I see purple textures and/or squares with yellow exclamation signs. What is the problem?</b></p>
      <p>Purple
        textures mean that a model is not finding the intended texture to use
        as a wrapper to its shape. Textures wrap around models and give them
        unique looks. Oblivion assigns the model a default deep purple texture
        whenever it cannot find the texture that the model asks it to display.</p>
      <p>Exclamation
        signs appear when the Oblivion engine wants to display a certain model,
        and it looks for it in a certain resource location, but does not find
        it. Oblivion defaults a square model with an exclamation sign, in this
        case, to be displayed.</p>
      <p>If you see any of this, it means that Oblivion is not finding textures or models where it is told that they should be.</p>

      <p>Usually,
        this means that you have not properly installed the content folders
        from the OOO download, or you only installed the UPGRADE version (which
        does not include all of the base resource files required). Make sure
        you move or copy the folders
        �Meshes� and �Textures� into your \Oblivion\Data folder.</p>
      <p>See the <a href="https://cs.uesp.net/wiki/index.php/Oblivion_Mods_FAQ" target="_blank">Oblivion Mods FAQ</a> for details. </p>

      <p><b>I have installed all content folders into my \Oblivion\Data folder, but I still see some purple textures. What is the problem?</b></p>

      <p>This problem can almost always be fixed by using a good invalidation method. See the <a href="https://cs.uesp.net/wiki/index.php/Oblivion_Mods_FAQ" target="_blank">Oblivion Mods FAQ</a> for details. </p>

      <p><b>I'm
          getting crashes and terrible FPS slowdowns when leaving the sewers and
          around the Imperial City, especially when near the water.</b></p>
      <p>Several
        things could be causing this problem. You can try disabling the OOO
        Water Weeds option if you use that, or you may want to try installing
        the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/5434" target="_blank">LowPoly Grass</a> mod to <span>reduce the complexity of the grass meshes</span> or the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/2069" target="_blank">Short Grass</a> mod to <span>get rid of all the underwater grass added by OOO 1.3</span>.
        If you use Short Grass, be sure to load it after OOO (LowPoly Grass
        doesn't have this issue since it's a pure mesh replacer and doesn't
        have any associated ESP load order issues). However, be aware that
        Short Grass will make it so you will not have any grass whatsoever in
        the water.</p>

      <p>Another thing to try is, before you exit the
        sewer, bring up the console and type this (without quotations, of
        course) "Set OOOFishSpawn to 0" This will stop fishes from being
        rendered by the engine. The scripts will still run, with less intensity
        though. This should help you troubleshoot.</p>
      <p>Another thing you
        can do is this. In the sewer, right before you exit, make a savegame
        there and then type in console "COC WawnetInnTavern", for example. See
        if you load fine. Test it by getting close to the water and see what
        happens. Walk in the city and check it out. Hopefully, if that loads
        fine, I would retry exiting the sewers' savegame again.</p>
      <p>Also, check to see if existing using a lower resolution (or no HDR) helps at first.</p>
      <p>Also, here's a good tip posted by Aeonus:</p>
      <p class="indent30"><i>"Just a tip for those who might be experiencing lag/stuttering after a fresh reinstall and addition of OOO and mods.</i></p>
      <p class="indent30"><i> was having the exact same issue. Horrible, hanging stuttering
          everywhere I went....especially whenever a new character would come on
          the screen. Wilderness and crowded areas were a horror because of it.</i></p>

      <p class="indent30"><i>Well,
          I tried everything.....driver reinstall, Oblivion reinstall, disabling
          mods, lowering settings. All short of reformatting my computer.</i></p>
      <p class="indent30"><i>Finally
          figured it out. It appears, even though I defragmented my HD before
          installing Oblivion and mods, that it was 3-4% fragmented. Normally
          this isn't that bad, however I looked at the details and to my suprise
          all of the fragmented files were from Oblivion.</i></p>
      <p class="indent30"><i>Defragged
          it, and now it runs smoothly again, with really sweet framerates to
          boot. I can confirm OOO doesn't cause framerate problems, though it is
          just my experience i'm going off of. Those people who are getting
          horrid framerates have other issues going on."</i></p>

      <p><b>Your
          explanation about using a Grass mod to help reduce crashes and terrible
          FPS slowdowns when leaving the sewers and around the Imperial City was
          confusing. Can you explain it again?</b></p>

      <p>Okay, let's try that one again. You may want to try installing the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/5434" target="_blank">LowPoly Grass</a> mod to reduce the complexity of the grass meshes. This mod is very easy
        to install and you don't have to worry about Load Order since it's a
        pure mesh replacer and doesn't have any associated ESP load order
        issues.</p>
      <p>You may also want to try the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/2069" target="_blank">Short Grass</a> mod. You can use this mod to alter just normal grass in the game by
        loading it before OOO. You can also use it to alter normal grass and
        get rid of all the underwater grass added by OOO 1.3 by loading it
        after OOO. Remember, if you load Short Grass after OOO, then you will
        not have any grass whatsoever in the water.</p>

          a new directory?</b></p>
      <p>Neither of those solutions will work for
        what you are trying to do. However, it is possible to use Oblivion Mod
        Manager (OBMM) to sync your active plugins list with your savegame
        (Utilities&gt;Save Manager). I am starting with two characters, one
        based on OOO 1.3 and other limited sum of mods, the other one with
        Francesco' s mod and quite a bunch of mods. Using OBMM as described
        above I can easilly switch among the two sets of active plugins. <i>(from

      <p>This

      <p><b>I keep meeting dangerous enemies in the Tiber Septim Hotel. The Frost Titan killed everyone there! Help!</b></p>
      <p>Tiber Septim Hotel is a dumping ground for some problematic spawns, but it's still unknown why this happens more often with OOO. The <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:The_Tiber_Septim_Hotel" target="_blank">UESP description</a> states that:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>The Tiber Septim Hotel lobby's cell is the game's "safe zone" to prevent crashes/bugs if a creature, NPC, or even the player is in a cell added by a mod and the mod is removed. Any any actors whose cell has disappeared will be placed in the hotel's lobby.
          This setting can be changed in Oblivion.ini. Find the line </p>
        <strong>
          <pre>SSaveGameSafeCellID=2AEEA</pre>
        </strong>
        <p>
          2AEEA is the form ID of the Tiber Septim lobby cell; this can be changed to any desired cell's form ID.
        </p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>One possible alternative would be to set this to the TestingHall, as in:
      </p>
      <blockquote><strong>
          <pre>SSaveGameSafeCellID=231AD</pre>
        </strong></blockquote>
      This will put any overflow spawns into the TestingHall, where you'll never see them unless you intentionally go there.
      <p></p>
      <p>Alternately, you could set them to spawn in the Arena in the hope that they might make some fights there more interesting:
      </p>
      <blockquote><strong>
          <pre>SSaveGameSafeCellID=91B46</pre>

      <p>Hot Key
        Torch is a dummy item used by Drop Lit Torches.
        You do not use it as a normal torch. If you want to use torches with a
        hotkey, point the hotkey to the Hot Key Torch item, and every time you use
        that hotkey a regular torch will be equipped by your character. </p>
      <p>The
        Official Patch 1.2 added the ability to set a hot key directly on a
        torch, but this is limited because you have to reset the hot key
        whenever your torch burns out. You will not have this problem if you
        use the Hot Key Torch instead.<br>

        take the time to do it, you can easily replace the mesh files with a
        set you prefer by copying the mesh files you do want over the ones you
        don't want.</p>

      <p>Replace

      <p><b>At what point does one start to feel like they have a chance against anything but mud crabs and deer?</b></p>

      <p>Plenty
        of people have reported being able to beat vampires, marauders,
        conjurers, necros and, certainly, bandits and goblins at lvl 1. Don't
        get discouraged, or think that all is hard just because of some tough
        battles early on. Keep searching, try ruins and forts near the IC
        (although some ARE hard, many are easy), invest in tactics, in regen
        potions, quest a little, steal a little even. As soon as you gain some
        nicer items, you'll be quickly growing in power.</p>
      <p>BTW, Black bow bandits are pretty tough -- those are not like regular bandits.</p>
      <p>Bandits, the normal kind? They can be as low as lvl 1, sometimes higher, sometimes lower, so those are usually sure hunt fodder.</p>
      <p>More would be a spoiler here ... so I'll keep quiet for now (slaughterfish ... cough, cough).</p>
      <p>If
        everything else fails to help you survive, you can always resort to
        using the difficulty slider, but be careful to only notch it down in
        small increments or it will quickly make the game too easy again.</p>

      <p><b>Does OOO alter anything in the Arena?</b></p>

      <p><b>Are there random dangerous areas or "static"? For instance will an area always contain high level creatures/loot?</b></p>
      <p>OOO
        is more static than default Oblivion, but not completely static.
        Some creatures and NPCs still level with you, but only within
        constraints. These have now minimum and maximum levels, so you will
        frequently run into places where the residents have a minimum level
        that's way above your own, making them too difficult for you to beat.
        By the same token, once you reach a medium level you'll start to find
        areas where the maximum is lower than you, making the residents much
        easier to beat than in vanilla. For example, at a high level you will
        find that common bandits no longer pose much of a threat (but they may
        have a boss who is still a threat).</p>
      <p>Also, within their
        possible level range, creatures and actors tend to vary in level. Some
        could be as low as 16 levels as their next �equal� type. For example,
        encountering bandits at level 10 may result in some bandits in the
        group being level 16, while others could be as low as level 2. This
        effect really increases variety and feel for each enemy as if they were
        unique.</p>

      <p>OOO gives horses their own faction. I should've

        faction to WILD horses. It does not change horses found in shops, or
        horses found in NPCs like couriers or guards.</p>
      <p>Thus, it should be compatible with saddlebags and slof's horses at least in all horses except WILD ones.</p>

        Plus, it affects an important NPC in OOO, and it changes one claymore,
        which would lose the weapon rebalance tweaks. However, you can probably
        resolve a lot of these issues by loading Banes before OOO.esp and using

          I
          know everyone says just load AFTER OOO and it will be fine and the
          smaller mods will overwrite a few OOO changes. But anyone know if I
          load them BEFORE OOO will I preserve OOO's nice changes to the NPC's
          without breaking important aspects of those mods?</b></p>

      <p>Ok
        man, check this out: University Cosmetics shouldn't be used with OOO,
        unless you trim a few key NPCs out of it. OOO already gives those guys
        better items, better robes
        and even better spells for sale (Borissean is bad ass). So, up to you,
        but I would not risk the changes just for a mere better looking face.
        (Want to miss out on Traven's uber armor?)</p>
      <p>Or, you could go in
        the editor, open the mod list, click the cosmetic mod, then set as
        active, then click on the "details" button, then in the window that
        pops up you'd delete every NPC entry that belongs to the important
        named NPCS, then hit ok, then hit ok again, that will load the cosmetic
        mod, minus the named NPC changes, then, once it is loaded, save it.</p>
      <p>Good
        to go, some npcs will be changed as cosmetic mod changes them, and the
        important ones will retain OOO's objects, spells, etc.</p>
      <p>Recent versions of Knights of the White Stallion can be used safely with OOO. Load it after OOO.<br>

        <li>A large selection of unique rewards for killing Gargoyles. Finally some well-deserved rewards can be gained if you are brave enough to defeat these powerful monsters. Huge thanks to bg2408 for this.</li>

This involves a huge amount of work and testing to get the BSA working properly, including fixes for texture paths, missing mipmaps, and various mesh properties.

        <li>Eliminated
          message spam from Drop Lit Torches and gave the Torch its name back.
          You'll need to reset your torch hotkey after you load this update, but
          you'll get an in-game message about this. Using your existing torch
          hotkey will start the swap process. If you don't have a hotkey, you can
          get one using the console~ StartQuest addtorchkey</li>

          Chorrol, Cheydinhal, Skingrad). </li>
        <li>Fixed a
          problem with the Slavers and Smugglers quest that caused the player to
          get the wrong final journal entry upon completing the quest. </li>
        <li>Fixed smearing effect on the map in Hlofor's Battle Plan.</li>
        <li>Prevented inebriation stat damage (inebriation debug message is now removed, too). </li>
        <li>Makes Armor Disposition system disabled by default (for existing 1.32 savegames, you still have to disable it in the console).</li>

        <li>Included Mannimarco script fixes from UOP. </li>
        <li>Disabled OOO fish spawn by default (for existing 1.32 savegames, you still have to disable it in the console).</li>
        <li>Rebalances
          elemental shield enchantments given by Sigil Stones to better match the
          shield strength changes made elsewhere in OOO (elemental shield
          enchantments should not be stronger than normal shield enchantments
          since they also give resistance to fire, frost, or shock attacks). </li>
        <li>Rebalanced
          fire resistance/weakness on ancient vampires (they were previously too
          resistant to fire damage given that fire is their only weakness).</li>
        <li>Removed commoners from the Bog Ogre spawn lists. </li>

      <h3>Light of Dawn sword fixes and improvements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The
          sword can now cure you of Porphyric Hemophilia, which is very handy if
          you catch the vampire disease while battling vampires (you have to kill
          a vampire to get the disease removed), but the sword now also cannot be
          used by anyone who is a vampire (if you try, you'll get a very nasty
          surprise).</li>
        <li>Count kills of all vampires from any mod rather than just OOO vampires.</li>

        <li>Adds
          kill count message so you know how the quest is progressing (message
          can be disabled using the console ~ Set OOOVampDeadMsg to 0 ).</li>
        <li>Adds distinct sound effects when you kill a vampire and at each stage of taint removal (i.e., when the sword gets upgraded).</li>
        <li>Slight kill-count bonus when you slay vampire bosses (patriarchs and matriarchs).</li>
        <li>Improved descriptions of the taint removal process. <br>

      <p><i>by Sotobrastos (with a few corrections by dev_akm)</i></p>
      <p>RC2
        and RC3 are smaller than the Open Beta and RC1 because there's now only
        one ESM in the download. The ESM gets put immediately in the
        \Oblivion\Data folder, alongside the Full version ESP. In the OOO
        folder, under OOO-Full and OOO-Lite now you can only find the different
        ESPs -- and you only need to do that if you want the Lite version.
        (This reduced the size of the uncompressed files by 20Mb, so even with
        the added resources of RC2/RC3 the file is smaller than the RC1
        download).</p>
      <h4><b>Important Notes</b></h4>

      <ul>
        <li>This
          version of 1.32 is a Release Candidate of the final version of 1.32.

          likelihood, as the Final version's ESM. However, some final changes may
          still take place to the ESM here included. In any case, mods crafted
          using this ESM will work with the final 1.32's ESM without any
          problems. </li>
        <li>Also, due to the change to an
          ESM/ESP structure, previous savegames will have one problem when used
          with 1.32 unless they were already updated to use OOO's ESM/ESP
          structure. We'll release an auto-patcher for your savegames with the
          final release of 1.32. For now, with this RC1, you may miss some
          OOO-specific items if you do not use Wrye Bash to modify your savegames
          to depend on the new OOO ESM/ESP structure. If your savegames depend
          (expect) a single OOO ESP (1.31 versions of OOO and below) then Wrye
          Bash allows you to tell those savegames to expect an ESP and an ESM.</li>
        <li>This
          requisite is temporary and proper only of the OOO 1.32 Open Beta and
          now the RC1/RC2/RC3 releases. Again, the final version of 1.32 will
          have an option in its installer to modify your savegames to expect the
          new ESM/ESP structure in case you were upgrading from an earlier
          version of OOO. See the <a href="OOO_Guide.html" target="_blank">Quick Start Guide</a> for detailed instructions.<br>
        </li>
        <li>There is a growing number of OOO-specific mods that we are compiling into a web-page for your convenience: <a href="OOO_Add-Ons.html" target="_blank">Oscuro Add-ons</a>.</li>

        <li>Harvest
          [Flora] was not included in RC2/RC3 because the version we had was out
          of date. [This is corrected in RC5 and later versions.] You can
          download the much improved v3 <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/2037" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>

      <h3>Changes in Release Candidate 3 (RC3)</h3>
      <p>Here are the changes between RC2 and RC3. See further down for details on the changes since 1.31.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Changed
          the way Inebriation works. Now, you can drink as many alcoholic
          beverages as you want without worrying about the hard-coded limit of
          potion-consumption. You will still have to exit the inventory screen
          after chugging from 3 to 5 bottles of booze so that you can immediately
          resume drinking. It is recommended, then, that you use alcohol before
          any of the regular potions that are tied to the variable of
          consumption-limit. Also, your Endurance now has a much clearer effect
          in how much alcohol you can consume before getting drunk. Also, drinks
          now give different, more suitable, effects and they do not count all
          the same in your level of drunkness (a beer is much less potent than a
          brandy, for example, but also gives less appealing effects.) Finally,
          the pick-up message given previously when grabbing these bottles has
          been removed.</li>
        <li>Added a custom OOO fix to
          Mannimarco in order to fix the bug whereby he would be immune to
          attacks and would not properly continue the King of Worms quest upon
          confronting him in Echo Cave.</li>
        <li>Added
          Player House markers. These will be revealed when you purchase a home.
          This change is meant also for people that used a house marker mod and
          had trouble with OOO's changes to prices of these same homes for which
          the markers were added by those other third-party mods. Now you do not
          need to use those mods to get your house markers.</li>
        <li>Removed
          the ability to Fast-Travel at the beginning of the game to all large
          city locations. Now, you need to discover the towns' landmarks before
          you can fast-travel to them. That is, you will need to walk at least
          once to each city in order to open fast-travel to their landmarks. (all
          large cities except the Imperial City)</li>
        <li>Added in a fix for Heaven's Fury Claymore's mesh. Thanks mmmpld for yet another OOO contribution!</li>

        <li>Added
          in the latest model of the Heaven's Fury and Heaven's Wrath models. I
          included both in case that you want to switch around the appearance of
          your Heaven's Fury armor. The files are all in data/meshes/armor/hf1
          and hf2 for the meshes and data/textures/armor/hf1 and hf2 for the
          textures. Also, now Melus Petilius has in his possession the Heaven's
          Fury cape. Right now, OOO uses the files in HF2 for its version of
          Heaven's Fury armor. Even in this folder you can find an alternative
          skin of the model. The same is true of the files in HF1--there is a
          default version and an alternative version.</li>
        <li>Fixed
          Umbra attacking always on sight. She should now go through her dialog
          with the player normally. But, her combat AI is still enhanced
          OOO-style.</li>
        <li>Fixed the container scripts so
          that certain NPCs would not have trouble updating Quest Stages due to
          container-interaction changes. For example, in the quest The Best Thief
          (where Methredel would fail to steal Amantius' stuff properly). All
          containers related to quests should perform their functions without any
          problems while being enhanced by OOO's container scripts.</li>
        <li>Fixed
          the double-sounds when opening or closing containers and changed all
          container scripts to allow for the toggling on and off of Harvest
          Container animations in-game. You have several options available.
          Containers are broken in several groups. Toggle the global to 0 in
          console if you want to disable their HC animations. Toggle it to 1 if
          you want to enable them. Listed next to each group is the name of the
          global responsible for toggling their HC animations on or off. For
          example, if you want to turn off HC animations in those containers
          found inside a home you have purchased then you'd have to type in
          console �set OOOHCPlayerHouse to 0� (without quotation marks). Here is
          the complete list:<br>
          a.Player house containers: OOOHCPlayerHouse<br>
          b.Chests, cupboards, desks, drawers and lecterns: OOOHC<br>

          c.Barrels and crates: OOOBarrelsAndCrates<br>
          d.Sacks: OOOHCSacks</li>
        <li>Now
          adventurers can loot clean dungeon containers while they explore the
          world. I have hand-placed several dozen new adventurers in the world
          that will compete with you for experience and loot while
          dungeon-crawling. The system by which they open a container is made
          more complex. If they are locked then the adventurers will use their
          lockpicks to open them. If they run out of lockpicks, they will not be
          able to open the said container. Finally, OOO traps now affect
          adventurers as well. So, you now have the dilemma of whether to let
          adventurers loot containers or not. They could get rid of a trap for
          you, and receive the damage themselves. But, by the same token, they
          could survive and take whatever was found inside the container.</li>
        <li>Added special Aura powers to Blood Thorn Amazons, as they were missing them in previous versions.</li>
        <li>Added
          one more optional Add-On: OOO-Magic_Script_Effect_Fix.esp. This add-on
          is meant for people that already use another third-party mod that
          changes the script-effect spell's entry. With it enabled, script-effect
          spells will not produce any sound or visual effects. This is included
          already with OOO-full and OOO-lite, but in cases where another mod that
          changes this MGEF entry was loaded after OOO then some OOO custom
          features that rely on Area of Effect scripted spells would produce a
          bothersome sound and light. Use this add-on to get rid of these effects
          only if you are using a mod that changes scripted-spell's entry.</li>
        <li>Added
          in .egm files so that custom light armor helmets now properly adjust to
          the player's race and gender head size. (most specially affecting the
          light armors of Sin's Armor pack).</li>

        <li>Lots
          of other small tweaks and fixes that did not get logged. They�ll be
          accounted for in future versions of OOO's documentation.</li>

    <h2 id="pageName">RC1 &amp; RC2 Changes</h2>

    <div class="story">
      <p>The RC1 &amp; RC2 versions have been out a long time now, but there's still a lot of good information in these old changelogs.</p>

      <h3>Additions in OOO 1.32 (RC1 and RC2)</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>ESP/ESM
          structure. This change is necessary to allow for greater compatibility
          between OOO and other third-party mods. Authors can quickly use the OOO
          ESM files to craft compatible versions of their work and even specific
          OOO-enhancements. </li>

        <li>Most OOO 1.3 quests
          have now journal updates added, new icons, new texts, new scripts, etc,
          in order to flesh them out even more in depth and with clarity. (These
          changes are worth many pages of text: OOO's quests are very open-ended
          and have lots of variables at play. Thus there are dozens of possible
          routes to finish some of these quests, albeit they still have some
          structure).</li>
        <li>Specifically, the affected quests are:</li>
        <li>a.<b> A Path of Iron</b>:
          new large quest featuring the lonely and rather underused Paladin in
          stock Oblivion, Melus Petilius. This quest is very lengthy and will
          reward one of the best sets of gear for those those goodie-two-shoes
          players that got no love in OOO's 1.3 Dread Armor quest. However, chose
          your allegiances wisely. Molag Bal will refuse to help those who side
          with Melus and his gods--nor will the Nine grant their blessing upon
          those who desecrate the honor of their chosen Paladin. Added a new
          lengthy text, new quest icon, a paiting of Vena, and other goodies that
          greatly expand the meaning of Melu's background.</li>
        <li>b.<b> Light through the Darkness</b>:
          you know her; you love her or you hate her. She is the bane of
          vampires, and one of the most coveted relics in Cyrodiil. Light of Dawn
          has now a fully-fledged quest with the addition of journal updates, new
          quest icon and tweaks to Lord Volmyr.</li>

        <li>c.<b> Shadows in a Struggle for Power</b>:
          this quest involves the Dread Arctifacts and the many factions that vye
          for power in an effort to collect them for themselves, and thus unlock
          their spectral power to their own ends. Again, this quest involves
          other sub-quests, like Jephre's Heart of Wild Woods, and the Raiders'
          missions to Forts in the Nibenay Basin. New quest icon and new graphics
          for some of the existing clues.</li>
        <li>d.<b> Skyrim Bandit Trouble</b>:
          this quest develops further than in 1.3 the story and background of the
          newly arrived clans of Skyrim bandits who assail the county of Bruma
          and other areas in northern Cyrodiil. Now, defeating the bandits has
          much clearer consequences in Bruma. New quest icon here as well.</li>
        <li>e.<b> Slavers and Smugglers</b>:
          the relation between the factions added to the Blackmarsh in 1.3 is now
          much more developed and clearly stated. New quest icon. There are new
          texts added to several of the key locations in this "quest." I use
          quotation marks because this is not a quest in the sense of all the
          other quests in Oblivion. This quest is dynamic. It has no end-point,
          unless all its important NPCs are killed, of course. You can go back
          and forth between your allegiances to these factions, although it will
          take you a long time to switch sides--once you begin to favor one of
          the two factions, turning the other way around will be more costly. The
          most clear reward is the possibility of trading with them. They offer
          items not available to any other vendor in the realm. Also, there are
          good role-play opportunities for those that want to flesh out their
          avatar's character.<br>

        </li>
        <li>Fully built-in
          Harvest Containers functionality alongside OOO's container scripts
          (chests animate, just as in HC, but now can be bashed and have traps,
          as in previous versions of OOO). I have included the latest version of
          HC's container models so as to fix their problems with animations in
          games patched with the official 1.2 patch. However, a certain feature
          of HC code--the unlocking of chests in a cell owned by a faction to
          which the player belongs--has been taken out for balance reasons given
          OOO's container loot's risk vs reward structure.</li>
        <li>New
          containers for each instance where a key exists to open it, and the
          lock is below lvl 100. So, no more lockpicking restriction bug with
          keys. Along with this change, some containers that were only accessible
          with a key can now also be lockpicked. In a similar addition, the new
          code prevents traps from triggering if you posses the specific key for
          that container.</li>
        <li>Dynamic response of NPCs
          to the type of attire and armor sets that the player's avatars may
          wear. This is a brand new feature in OOO that uses many of its unique
          resources as vehicles to change the behavior of NPCs towards your
          avatars. Now, whenever you don certain pieces of armor or items of
          clothing, or even weapons, those around you will be affected in seeing
          them. Depending on their nature they will look more favorably upon you
          or perhaps even despise you. The sight of your gear will make their
          disposition towards you either rise or drop. Also, their confidence
          will follow the same pattern. These effects are stronger as more pieces
          of that kind of armor and/or attire are worn. The effects tend to drop
          when you remove the gear from sight. Now you can indulge in scaring
          citizens away with your Daedric looks or strike righteous fear upon
          evil hearts with your Paladin's armor. The following is a list of armor
          sets and attires that affect NPCs around you:<br>
          <strong>a</strong>. <strong>Daedric Nature</strong>:
          Dremora Elite Armor, Daedric Armor, Daedric Prince Armor, Guardian of
          Oblivion's clothing and Lady of Embers' special robes, hood and gloves.<br>

          b. Necromantic
          Nature: Dread Armor, Necromancer cloaks and hoods, Putrid Hand cloaks
          and hoods, Master Necromancer clothing, Fayth Noor's robes and hood,
          Lien Valeth's robes and shoes and Mannimarco's entire gear (robes, hood
          and staff)<br>
          <strong>c</strong>. <strong>Holy Nature</strong>: Heaven's Fury Armor<br>
          <strong>d</strong>. <strong>Law
            Nature</strong>: Worn Legion armor, Imperial Legion Tarnished Armor, Imperial
          Legion Armor, Imperial Warder Armor, Imperial Guardian Armor, Imperial
          Watch Armor, Imperial Palace Armor, Imperial Elite Armor, Imperial
          Commander Armor and Arch-Mages' robes, hood and staff.<br>
          <strong>e</strong>. <strong>Shadows' Nature</strong>: Dark Brotherhood garbs and hood, Shadowmail Armor and Night Elven Armor.<br>

          <strong>f</strong>. ***NOTE***:
          Although this novel feature relies on mechanics that will not affect
          performance in any way, you can still disable it if you prefer to play
          without it. It can be turned off by typing in console:<i><br>
            StopQuest OOODispositionToPlayer</i><br>
        </li>
        <li>Added three of LCE creatures in this release: Gargoyles, Guars and Ravishing Hungers:<br>
          <strong>a</strong>.
          Ravishing Hungers are now included among the possible daedra you will
          find in Oblivion and in its gates to Cyrodiil. They are a bit stronger
          than seducers, faster and more active in their attacks. They have
          unique combat styles. They primarily use magic from the Absorb line of
          spells. While aggressive they are also prone to fleeing more readily
          than other Daedra. Like the rest of OOO's Daedra, Hungers have specific
          resistances and weaknesses. They also may yield Hunger's Skin, a new
          alchemy ingredient. These Hungers are a sub-set of the Hunger's family.
          However, if you prefer them to look exactly like Shivering Isle's
          Hungers then be sure to fetch Madcat's mod for OOO that replaces them
          with SI versions. Links to the OOO mods' page are listed at the bottom
          of this document.<br>
          <strong>b</strong>. Gargoyles are fairly unique in OOO. They do
          not belong to the "evil" group of creatures (Ogres, Shadow Wolves,
          Trolls and Imps). But they are not considered neutral like most other
          creatures. They straddle the fine line in between them. They are
          closely associated with Imps, and are often seen in their company. They
          prefer caves and/or ruins to appear, but are also found in hills and
          mountains. They have very strong abilities and can shield themselves
          against most forms of attacks for brief periods of time while they
          regenerate, but they are unable to move when that happens. They, like
          the other new additions, have specific new Faction, Combat Style,
          Abilities, Spells and Ingredients. Gargoyles are usually stronger than
          Mystical Imps, and they vary in their abilities and overall prowess.<br>

          <strong>c</strong>. Guars
          appear in several variations: Ashen, Wild Swamp, Wild and Tamed. Ashen
          Guar are darkened in color and very rare, found only in the mountains
          on Vvanderfell's frontier. Wilds are regular guars that may appear also
          along this mountain range. Wild Swamp Guars roam the Blackmarsh swamps.
          Each of them have special combat styles, weaknesses, resistances and
          items (pelts and meat). Although generally not aggressive, they are
          very sturdy and strong creatures. Some may also be quite aggressive if
          you tread on their territory.<br>
          <strong>d</strong>. Finally, the Tamed Guar may be
          acquired through those that frequent Vvanderfell and have connections
          with Dunmer traders. You may have to "convince" the traders to somehow
          accept to deal with you--either by force or kindness, it is up to you.
          This Guar can be ridden like a horse.<br>
        </li>
        <li>New spell icons thanks to Spell Icon Replace 1.0 mod by Forsaken32. </li>
        <li>Added Nicoroshi's Ayleid Meteoric Bow replacement--an addition that also exists now for Madcat's stand-alone great mod.</li>
        <li>Re-designed
          vanilla NPC armor/weapon lists. Those were used only in a handful of
          cases in 1.31, they are not used any more by 1.32. They are re-designed
          just in case they are put to use by other mod when working in tandem
          with OOO. For example, Fran's or MMM's mods may do it. This way their
          items will remain leveled, but with the item rarity of early versions
          of OOO. Thanks to Dev_Akm for those lists! He worked at them fiercely
          and they look very good--it is easy for others to tweak them at will.</li>

        <li>Updated
          the UoP compatibility to 2.00 version. That is, OOO includes its
          changes wherever there are overlaps between the two mods. There were a
          lot of small overlaps, but they are too many to list here in detail.
          UoP changes a myriad spelling mistakes, for example, in NPC names. I
          included all of those since OOO also changes those NPCs statistics,
          gear, level data, faces, etc. That's just one small example from the
          large lot of changes that this compatibility entailed.</li>
        <li>Added
          in Vagabond Angel's Femme-Daedric armor. This is part of a new special
          Daedric set that will be related to quests in future versions of OOO,
          although right now it is available should you be able to best the
          enemies that guard it. <i>Two of VA's extra helmet models are used --
            #2 and #3 -- but all three of VA's alternate meshes are included in
            case you want to swap them by renaming their meshes.</i> They are
          located in \Data\meshes\armor\VA\Fdaedric. Also, this female version is
          used for a new set of Dremora armor: Elite Dremora Armor, of which you
          will be able to get only one full set.</li>
        <li>Added
          Mmmpld's Female Dwemer model to replace what is used in stock Oblivion.
          Now, female characters can use Dwemer armor fitted to their figures. </li>
      </ol>
      <p><i>(The following are changes added in RC2)</i></p>

      <ol start="19">
        <li>Also
          Mmmpld rigged a better version of the Unfinished Steel Cuirass that is
          now included. Finally, he made a new Unfinished BlackWood Company
          Cuirass that now can be seen used by the BlackWood Company Guards. They
          have now a more appropriate set of armor lists.</li>
        <li>Added
          in Leviathan's Soul Gems (by Star Boi) to replace the stock Oblivion
          soul gem's models. These new models look much like those found in
          Morrowind and are a real treat to the eyes. I changed their resource
          folders and texture names, when appropriate, to avoid BSA Archive
          Invalidation issues. Also, I edited their icons' background to better
          mesh with the default colors of the menu's backgrounds. This addition
          is not included in the Lite version of OOO, unless you use the
          OOO-Magic_Effects+Enchantments Add-On.</li>
        <li>Added
          several dozen new wilderness spawns in areas that were severely lacking
          wildlife, like swamps and rainforests. Also, I added a good number of
          new forest wilderness spawns. In this pass through the wilderness of
          Cyrodiil I changed several existing spawns to better suit them to the
          geography where they were placed. Finally, I changed even more how
          bandit spawns are found in roads (they should be much more
          unpredictable) and also added new spawns outside of certain lairs that
          previously did not have any (amazons, raiders and goblins, for example).</li>
        <li>Added four new optional Add-on modules:
          <br>a. <span style="font-weight: bold;">OOO-Container_Trap_Instant_Effects</span> (turns chests traps into instant-effects to avoid CTDs with UI mods that change spell timers to be displayed in text)

          <br>b. <span style="font-weight: bold;">OOO-Level_Stock</span> (default Oblivion leveling rates but with OOO's perk descriptions)
          <br>c. <span style="font-weight: bold;">OOO-Respawn_Two_Week</span> (sets the respawn time to two weeks)
          <br>d. <span style="font-weight: bold;">OOO-Water_Weeds</span> (enables water weeds for the Lite version of the mod)
        </li>

    <h3 id="pageName">Tweaks in OOO 1.32 (RC1 and RC2)</h3>

    <div class="story">

      <ol>
        <li>I have re-shaped many elements to make the balance be smoother in so far as gameplay difficulty in beginner areas:<br>
          <br>
          <b>a</b>.Vilverin's
          exterior bandits will be a bit easier than before. The dungeon itself
          is still not a low-level dungeon any more, but hunting around it should
          not be as difficult.<br>
          <br>
          <b>b</b>.Changed several road spawns near the IC to reflect the above difficulty rating.<br>

          <br>
          <b>c</b>.Sideways
          Cave retains its "Imp-Dungeon" character, but its weaker imps are now
          more aggressive and less prone to fleeing. The special chest at the
          bottom of this dungeon is better positioned to avoid instances where
          players got "stuck" in the nearby roots.<br>
          <br>
          <b>d</b>.Cleared some
          rather dangerous spawns in the road north of Chorrol. This will make
          the MG admission quest stage of this city a bit safer to accomplish at
          early levels.<br>
          <br>
          <b>e</b>.A host of other small changes ranging
          from creature aggressiveness and speed to guard-patrols' pathing in
          order to make it a bit less dangerous in the IC's vicinity.
        </li>

        <li>Tweaked
          several bosses' difficulty, gave them new spells, new custom scripts,
          even more combat variety and special notes, mentions and fame increases
          in case of being defeated. They will now use spells more appropriately
          according to the battle-necessities of the moment (if you are invisible
          they may try to dispel it, they will use their stronger attacks more
          often, buff themselves more often, etc.) Some of the affected NPCs are:
          Black Rock Captain, Eregor, Faran Hestarius, Hlofor The Arctic Bear,
          Lareil, Lady of Embers, Lien Valeth, Lord Volmyr, Marlek, Reaver of
          Ghuul Icxth, Sheil Hestarius, Voice of Nature, Vyka Herlst and Prince
          Xyval Viktur.</li>
        <li>Changed some creature lists
          and added new critters to indoor locations so that the
          "ogre-won't-fit-through-tunnel" type of problems disappear. There may
          be some instances where large enemies have a difficult time maneuvering
          in close-quarters, but that should also be an option open for players
          to use in their combat tactics. The incidence of this happening is much
          reduced.</li>
        <li>Added more spell weaknesses to
          certain NPCs, to diversify even more the types of effective spell
          forms. Made weakness to frost a bit more common in certain enemies. The
          benefits of using other magic-based attacks were larger than using
          frost. That is no longer the case.</li>
        <li>Changed
          the way you receive (or can get) Hannibal Traven's new Battle Mage
          armor. It will not appear in his body any more before he sends you to
          face Mannimarco. Rather, it is stashed somewhere in his
          living-quarters. This way, players will not miss a chance to recover it
          due to Traven's body disappearing.</li>
        <li>Changed
          some Daedric armors and their special Dremora wearers in stages of the
          Main Quest. Now there is a special version of Dremora armor called
          Elite Dremora Armor. Also, now you will not be able to stock several
          Daedric Prince Shields and Gauntlets--there is one set of Daedric
          Prince and one set of Dremora Elite armor in total.</li>
        <li>Changed
          some quest stages so that they are in tune with the new journal
          structures and also to prevent problems (like killing Reaver of Ghuul
          Icxth before you can wield spectral weapons).</li>

        <li>Changed a few of the geomantic spells to make them more balanced. Specifically, the Opal's shield effects are now less powerful.</li>
        <li>Changed
          also some NPCs' and critters' AI, combat styles and inventories to make
          them even more interesting and balanced against their status, role,
          etc. Quite a few changes here, too long, and sometimes unnoticiable, to
          list here in detail. (For example, Ogres tended to be overly aggressive
          with their forward power attacks--now some of them will be much less
          direct in their fighting style).</li>
        <li>Drastically
          diversified the combat styles of vampires. Even though I had made new
          combat style sheets for them I had forgotten to ascertain that vampires
          were using them. They were not. Now they'll show more difference in
          their combat behaviors. </li>
        <li>Changed several
          critters' level of aggression and faction interaction (imps, for
          example. Seridur won't fight against blood golems, the goblin chef is
          now safe against retribution from his clan's members, ghosts and other
          undead do not immediately get into fights with liches (that was a
          leftover mess from stock Oblivion. Perhaps intended, but it sure
          whacked the suspense and challenge of some fights.) Included 1.31d's
          change to Spectral Warrior's faction so that they no longer can yield a
          murder count.</li>
        <li>Tweaked the Scamp's levels of confidence and stats to better diversify among them and to make them more unique among Daedra. </li>
        <li>Added
          a new faction to Alteration-based Golem Summoning spells. They will now
          react more "forcefully" against other factions that should be "evil"
          but are not due to the game's design (like the Arena's Yellow Team, for
          example).</li>

        <li>Added a script to the
          enchanting altar so that certain items are dropped from the player's
          inventory prior to enchanting them. These items have special scripts
          that get removed once the item gets enchanted. That is how the Oblivion
          engine works, and this method of "fixing" this problem was the least
          obtrussive possible.</li>
        <li>Changed some
          quest-award item's enchantments so that they regain more uses after
          having lost them previously due to the larger mana cost introduced
          since OOO 1.3.</li>
        <li>Changed the Aetherial
          Magicka Flow ability of Meteoric Weapons to give an increased mana
          regeneration depending on the Willpower value of their user. Higher
          willpower will make the sword's magical essences react more readily and
          dispense more magicka in return.</li>
        <li>Changed
          Bosmer Ranger and Bosmer Protector's abilities so that they last longer
          in their fights against their former companions, the now bloodthirsty
          corrupted followers of Jephre.</li>
        <li>Changed
          how the Ayelid ruins infected by the Corrupted Followers of Jephre
          behave once you defeat Eregor and Lareil. Now their ranks will be much
          thinner, and in some cases they will leave the dungeons altogether.</li>
        <li>Fixed
          Corrupted Followers of Jephre possibly becoming friendly to the player.
          That's something that will be possible in future versions of OOO, but
          not in 1.32</li>

        <li>Changed how Fort Facian and
          Fort Flecia are populated after the Raider parties there are defeated.
          This change is related to the Shadows in a Struggle for Power quest,
          like change # 18.</li>
        <li>Changed the density
          population of Skyrim Bandits as your progress through the quest that
          aids Bruma in getting rid of them. Now, they will appear in less
          numbers and less frequently if you manage to undermine their
          allegiance's pillars.</li>
        <li>Changed how touching spectral creatures and shields affects the player while they wear the Dread Armor set. </li>
        <li>Increased
          a little the range at which summoned golems and animals stop while
          following the player--they will not so closely crowd around the player
          any more. </li>
        <li>Changed Boetiah's Chosen to be more effective in battle, to better correspond to the level of difficulty proper to the quest. </li>
        <li>Several
          tweaks to other magical abilities proper to special creatures, like the
          Unicorn, for example, to tone down their power a notch. They'll still
          be very difficult, but not overly so. The Arena Champion, Agronak, also
          needed a bit of toning down in its magic resistances. Casters should
          not find it so difficult to connect spells against him any more.</li>

        <li>Changed
          the model for the Heart of the Wild Woods and the Blood Golem. The
          former will glow more and the latter will be much less shiny, properly
          showing the effects of shadows upon its body.</li>
        <li>Changed
          the Thieves Guild quests responsible for the Stolen Goods' quest
          updating properly. This quest is notoriously problematic, and the UoP
          also attempts several fixes to it that I have included whenever there
          were overlaps between both of our tweaks to the TG quests. Previously,
          OOO failed to account for the new values of TG Stolen Goods' quest
          properly.</li>
        <li>Tweaked some of the Master
          Trainers so that they remain essential until their quests are started.
          Also beefed them up considerably, since they are supposed to be masters
          of their craft and powerful entities, after all.</li>
        <li>Deer are now faster. Boars are also a bit faster now.</li>
        <li>Diversified
          some of the creatures' possible sizes a bit more, yet still within
          tight limits, to avoid the "giant-animal" syndrome. That's reserved
          only for animal/creature bosses.</li>
        <li>Increased the price of most pelts even more, to make them more attractive for hunting.</li>

        <li>Toned
          down the density of bandits along roads and also added the possibility
          that their main opposing faction, marauders and raiders, attack the
          usual bandit hang-out areas.</li>
        <li>Fixed the
          Cowl of Nocturnal's new script and powers from what was inherited
          through Daeger's mod. I reworked the scripts so that they do not rely
          any more on game-mode blocks. I added a new quest script and changed
          the powers' status so that they get properly added and removed whenever
          the cowl is equipped and unequipped.</li>
        <li>Changed
          how the formulas for bashing a lock get their results. Now, using H2H
          will be much less effective than 2Hblunt. I also tweaked the values in
          between. Generally, in ascending fashion, the effectivity increases
          thus: H2H, 1Hblade, 1Hblunt, 2Hblade, 2Hblunt.</li>
        <li>Increased the range at which creatures or NPCs will be alerted because of lock-bashing.</li>
        <li>Corrected
          several spelling mistakes left over from previous OOO version additions
          in text. Most clear will be the change from spelling "Cheydinhall" to
          the correct "Cheydinhal." Some changes also applied to 1.3 added texts,
          like "Excerpts of Tamriel's Societies", "Practical Defense of
          Morrowind" and other in-game clues.</li>
        <li>Clarified some of the texts' writing for better understanding and characterization.</li>

        <li>Book
          on Ayleid Geomancy can now be taken. If you want to disable geomancy
          after reading this book then type in console: Set GeomancyEnabled to 0</li>
        <li>Fixed
          the Ayleid's Magicka Regeneration ability to properly continue its
          effects once the clock changes from PM to AM at night time.</li>
        <li>Fixed
          the problem with the Tiber Septim Hotel being a dumping ground for some
          problematic spawns. This fix is not global. It is dependent on code
          added to some of the usual suspects that popped up in there often
          (frost minotaurs, Sheil Hestarius, Lareil, Vyka Helrst, etc.) So, it is
          possible that at times another critter will appear there, but it won't
          be as game-shattering as before.</li>
        <li>Changed a couple of weapon and armor stat values. Just small tweaks that will not be overly apparent.</li>
        <li>Changed
          Silver Dragon arrows, Blood Thorn arrows and White Rose arrows to be
          more powerful than previously--also, they are more valuable now.</li>
        <li>Made Ungarion be able to have more Open-Lock scrolls, plus it now has the chance of holding powerful Ayleid Staves in his stock.</li>

        <li>Re-worked
          all Vampires who still used some original Oblivion loot lists. I did
          the same for every other entity or quest that OOO changes and that used
          LL0, LL1 or LL2 NPC loot lists. They were given, instead, appropriate
          OOO-specific lists.</li>
        <li>Modified Molag Bal's quest updates to reflect the possibility of having sided with the Nine in becoming their chosen Paladin.</li>
        <li>Fixed
          some issues with the Open Beta of 1.32 and A Path of Iron quest where
          you could lose Melus' armor and claymore if you had already started
          Molag Bal's quest--also, I corrected the problem with not being able to
          pick up Path of Iron once dropped to the ground. Finally, now Path of
          Iron has a powerful holy enchantment that does not require re-filling
          it with soul gems.</li>
        <li>Changed the trap's
          spell effects to avoid those cases where they would not affect the
          player due to hitting geometry in their path after being triggered.</li>
        <li>Added
          Vicente's Valtieri's key to the game-world. It was previously missing
          and thus the only way to open his chest was through lockpicking or
          bashing.</li>
        <li>Changed the sound effects of
          Frost-based spell effects to use a set of sounds included in the
          Oblivion resource files but not implemented in the game.</li>

        <li>Reduced
          a bit the enchantments from the Ebony Helmet of the Mage, Eboron Helmet
          of the Conjurer, Ring of the Iron fist. Also reduced slightly the power
          of Glass (regular, Drakefired and Blue) and Elven Eldar cuirasses using
          the Mirror effect (reflect damage and reflect spell).</li>
        <li>The Heart of the Wild Woods no longer sounds as "killed" when he finally reaches Yeleri and disappears.</li>
        <li>Increased the price of Bloodgrass and Harrada to reflect their supposed rarity (they grow in Oblivion only).</li>
        <li>Tweaked
          the Night-Eye rings. They were too powerful before and it made no
          difference to find the lowest value ring of the type as opposed to a
          higher quality one. So, now these low-end rings have a penalty. Since
          they increase sensitivity to light they also increase weakness against
          fire-based magic. The higher quality rings of Night-Eye progressively
          lessen this penalty until it disappears in the highest quality ring of
          this type.</li>
        <li>Rebalanced the Finger of the
          Mountain spells. They are now more powerful and have slightly more
          range, but they also cost less and thus are finally accessible to
          highly skilled wizards.</li>
        <li>Fixed a couple of floating skellies and containers (Shattered Scales Cave and Rielle).</li>

        <li>Adjusted the position of an Imperial Notice in Cheydinhal so as to make it easier to activate and read.</li>
        <li>Fixed Audens Avidius so that his OOO gear gets correctly removed in the quest "Imperial Corruption."</li>
        <li><i>(Note: From here down are changes added in RC2 -- and many added after Soto's first post about it.)</i></li>
        <li>Fixed Chanel's lectern not updating properly the stages of quest "Canvas the Castle." </li>
        <li>Added more instances of Open Lock, Kill
          and Detect Trap spells to vendors of magical scrolls. Specially, Shady
          Sam has had its stock increased more in proportion to other vendors. </li>
        <li>Increased the amount of goods sold by
          the Argonian Smugglers of the Blackmarsh and the Dunmer Slave Traders.
          They now sell thief-friendly items in greater quantities than before,
          specially the Smugglers. </li>

        <li>Increased the amount of special sylvan and ayleid arrows used by Corrupted Followers of Jephre and Bosmer Rangers. </li>
        <li>Fixed an overlapping OOO chest with the
          bed added by the Frostcrag DLC official Bethesda Add-On to the Mystic
          Emporium's bedrooms. </li>
        <li>Fixed a potential issue with picking up
          the Heart of the Wild Woods in Narind. This problem was unique to the
          first release of OOO 1.32 RC1. </li>
        <li>Invisible Gargoyle problem from RC1 corrected.</li>
        <li>Debug messages and spells are fixed for both the Full and Lite versions' new disposition vs gear feature </li>
        <li>Ayelid regeneration script is fixed to account properly for the higher level stages of your wisdom</li>

        <li>VA's daedric helmet is fixed now for females (no more side-ways head). </li>
        <li>68- All optional add-ons for the lite now work as they should (dependent on the ESM when necessary.) </li>
        <li>Fixed some ayleid weapons in FG buildings to now require a high rank in the guild to be picked up without counting as stealing.</li>
        <li>Lite
          now does not have the OOO leveling rates and descriptions. That's what
          the OOO-Level_Normal, OOO-Level_Slow and OOO-Level_Stock are for. The
          new <span style="font-weight: bold;">OOO-Level_Stock.esp</span> gives default Oblivion leveling rates but with OOO's perk descriptions.</li>
        <li>A few other small things that the RC1 had messed up.</li>

        <li>Lots
          of other small tweaks and fixes that did not get logged. They'll be
          accounted for in a future version of this 1.32 list of changes document.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>So,
        there it is. A few small things, like Marie Elena's fix to one of the
        locked chests, repositioning of vanilla floating barrels, etc, did not
        make it into the document. They are too small to list all of them. <br>
        <br>
        Make
        sure to let the files overwrite what you have already in the
        \Oblivion\Data\ folder --there won't be any damage by doing so.
